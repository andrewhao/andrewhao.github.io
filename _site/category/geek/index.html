Additionally, I’d be getting weak signals from all these weird corners in my apartment. Since I had a spare AP lying around at home, I decided to do some online research to see if I could get it to behave as a second wireless AP on the same network, extending my network range, allowing our network to handle more wireless users and playing nicely with my laptop.

  <p class="post-listing__preview">One trend on the Web these days is to move away from traditional full-stack frameworks (like Rails) toward client-side, full-stack Javascript frameworks (among them Dojo, GWT, SproutCore, and Cappuccino). There’s been a lot of buzz about SproutCore and Cappuccino, because of their design elegance, shiny Mac-ness and promises of really rich client experiences. I’ve been checking them out and here’s some of my observations so far:

  <p class="post-listing__preview">In Spring 2008, I took an information architecture course in the UC Berkeley School of Information, taught by Erik Wilde (disclaimer: I dropped the course after a month because of schedule conflicts). An interesting part of my research for that class involved investigating the nascent Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) protocol, a way of organizing groups of resources across the Web. I’m going to try to describe in laymen’s terms what I learned from my research and explain why it’s significant.
