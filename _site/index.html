I talked about how I started building a Raspberry Pi project with a USB mic and wrote a simple parsing script that measured the mean amplitude of recordings of the current state of the nursery.

After weeks of being stuck in a really deep rut, I’ve finally stumbled upon something that’s decently interesting with regards to the state of the Taiwanese blogsophere (this is an assignment for my International Media class). I’m finally following up on what I previously discussed with regards to the state of the Taiwanese blogosphere. I’ll be running a textual analysis.on Chinese and English blogs as they cover the controversy over the closing of the Losheng sanitorium.

The Losheng (ï¿½Ö¥ï¿½) sanitorium, a structure built to house lepers during Japan’s occupation of Taiwan (still housing many today) is a memorial to Taiwan’s history (also serving as a reminder of suppressed human rights). In 1994, a plan was drafted to build a rail yard for the MRT transit system over the sanitorium, effectively demolishing and destroying it. The scheduled demolition date was April 15, 2007, but an extraordinary upswell of protest (largely coordinated and managed online) managed to raise money and awareness of the decision, pleading to preserve the sanitorium out of respect for remaining patients and preservation of a historical location. A day before the 4/15 deadline, the decision was delayed and reconsidered. Two things are significant about this:

Things have changed. Life’s been busy. It’s been hard finding time to pause, reflect and put metaphorical pen to paper.

I try to be as candid as possible but I have to be honest: it’s hard here. I might attribute it to the blinding lights of Xanga and its close-knit community that is both a blessing and a curse. Here I find an audience, but at times I know I must hold back. Maybe that’s okay.

  <p class="post-listing__preview">Do you remember? We were freckle-faced high schoolers tumbling over China, our obnoxious American mannerisms betraying our origins despite our butter skin. We had agreed to stay in shape during that trip, so the first night one of us had the bright idea to do stairwell repeats up the fire escape. So we laced up our sneakers and bounded up the stairs two by two, laughing between breaths, running single file and breathing musty cigarette air. I remember losing count of the stairs we had climbed, unfocusing my eyes and watching each set of steps blur by in my field of vision, wondering when I would fall. I didn’t. By the twenty-fifth floor the stairs ended and we poured out onto the rooftop of Beijing, stars bright as our eyes, daring each other to look down at the maze of city streets below. Some of us pantomimed a fall. We didn’t.

  <p class="post-listing__preview">Oftentimes in Verilog code, we build testbenches (test fixtures). A common thing to do is to instantiate a module and plug in wires of the same names.

Now a common hack is to copy and paste the module declaration line (the “prototype,” if you will). The prototype looks like this:

  <a class="title-listing" href="/2007/02/27/liveblogging-from-the-stacks/">Liveblogging from: the Stacks</a>
  <p class="post-listing__preview">I have friends who run a cost-benefit analysis on every decision. And they’re always measuring things up against Time. Freakin, Endless, Time. I think I’m one of them, too. May it never be so.



I remember why I’ve never liked the stacks: these chairs are pretty much the least ergonomic chairs ever built, on par with medieval torture devices.

I remember why I’ve missed the stacks: being here makes me feel smarter. And how time somehow seems to stands still, but that might be the artificial lighting and the fact I’m fifty feet underground.



There was a study done a long time ago where a woman volunteered to live underground for like a month. And they measured her sleep cycles, and it went wack by about a week (can anybody name this study or correct me if I’m wrong?). I always wondered what kind of music you’d listen to if you were underground for that long. And if she ever figured out how to work a Rubik’s cube. Being underground for that long seems like a good way to determine cube optimization strategies.



Oh, essay. The closer I get to the end, the harder it gets to write. 9 pages down, three to go and I’ll either finish in one hour or in six.



Edit: it was six.

  <a class="title-listing" href="/2007/02/25/taiwan-roundup/">Taiwan Roundup</a>
  <p class="post-listing__preview">So I’m writing the first part of my International Media paper on the structures of the media systems in Taiwan. Just wanted to share with you what I’ve been coming across in my research so far:

Here’s a aggregate blog of many of the main English blogs on/in Taiwan.

Interestingly enough, many of the high-visibility English political blogs have heavy DPP rhetoric where many of my 1.5-gen Taiwanese friends at school and back home lean blue. It’ll be interesting to discover where native Taiwanese political pundits/bloggers lean.

A photo blogger posts photos from the perspective of a foreigner in Taiwan.

Portnoy Zheng, a Taiwanese graduate student keeps a blog (this is his lesser-updated English blog) on Taiwanese media with a particular Web emphasis.

I am also following another interesting conversation regarding Taiwanese bloggers–the complaint that the English and Taiwanese blog communities are largely independent of one another. Michael Turton describes the need to unify the two realms:
