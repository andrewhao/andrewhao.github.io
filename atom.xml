    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, I was tuning a Rails app for one of our clients.
This client wanted to know how performant their app would be under load.</p>

<p>To do that, you can do several different things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tune the thread/process balance within the VM</li>
<li>Horizontally scale with your cloud platform.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a discussion of the former (#1):</p>

<h2>1) Set up the test</h2>

<h3>Drive with a synthetic script</h3>

<p>Our application had a synthetic load driver that would run Selenium to
execute various app tasks. This synthetic driver could be parallelized
across many notes via Rainforest QA, Sauce Labs or Browserify.</p>

<p>In our case, I only needed to run our synthetic load script on a single
node in multiple processes, which simulated enough load to anticipate
another order of magnitude of traffic.</p>

<h3>Know how to inspect the server under load.</h3>

<p>Commands you will want to know:</p>

<pre><code>$ free -m # Find the total amount of free memory on your machine
$ ps uH p &lt;pid&gt; # List out process threads
$ kill -TTIN &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Add a puma worker
$ kill -TTOU &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Remove a puma worker
$ kill -USR2 &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Kill the puma master &amp; workers
</code></pre>

<h2>Generating more load: use external load testing services, or plain tools.</h2>

<p>Try using <a href="http://www.flood.io">Flood.io</a> or JMeter for performance load.</p>

<p>I tried looking into the <a href="https://github.com/schneems/puma_auto_tune">puma_auto_tune</a> gem, but it required a higher level of production instrumentation than I was ready to give it.</p>

<h2>Analysis: New Relic scalability analysis</h2>

<p>New Relic gave us a scalability analysis scatter plot, plotting
throughput against average application response time. In essence, it
allows you to see spikes in response times as correlated to throughput.</p>

<h2>Process:</h2>

<p>My approach was to use the synthetic script to generate productionlike
node and ramp up the # of load actors in 5m increments. Each run would
test the following Puma process/thread balance:</p>

<p>Run #1: Single-process, multi threads.
Run #2: Multiple processes, single threaded.
Run #3: Multiple processes, multiple threads.</p>

<blockquote><h3>Aside: <em>how many</em> of these threads/processes should I be using?</h3>

<p>Note that your numbers will be different on the execution
characteristics of your app and your server environment. Tweak it for
yourself. You&rsquo;re designing an experiment.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, our Rails app started out with 4 threads on 2
workers. We made the # of Puma workers (both min and max) environment
variables so we could tweak the variables easily without deploying.</p></blockquote>

<p>The strategy was then to look at the perf characteristics of each run in
the scatter plot. If there were any spikes in the graph with the
increase of load, then that would be noted. Even minor features like an
increase in slope would be noted &ndash; at that point, the incremental cost
of each request increases with overall system load.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the New Relic data on hand to show, now, but in our case we
discovered two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The server easily scaled from ~10 &ndash;> ~500 rpm with a virtually flat
line for all runs.</li>
<li>The app exhibited no noticeable performance differences when flipped
between uniprocess-multithreaded, multiprocess-unithreaded, and
multiprocess-multithreaded modes. Any performance gains were under a
tolerable threshold.</li>
</ol>


<p>How do we parse these results?</p>

<ul>
<li>We note that we didn&rsquo;t really push the performance threshold on this
app (it&rsquo;s not meant to be a public web site and 95% of it is behind a
login wall to a specialized group of users). Thus, if we pushed the
concurrent connections even more, we may have seen more of a pronounced
difference.</li>
<li>The <em>absence</em> of any major red flags was itself a validation. The
question we wanted answered coming into this experiment was &ldquo;how close
are we to maxing out our single-node EC2 configuration such that we will
have to begin configuring horizontal scaling?&rdquo;? The answer was: we can
safely scale further out in the near-term future, and cross the bridge
of horizontal scaling/bursting when we get there.</li>
<li>We did not have enough statistically significant differences in
performance for #threads/#processes in Puma. However, if we wanted to
truly find the optimal performance in our app, we would have turned to
tools like <a href="https://github.com/schneems/puma_auto_tune">puma_auto_tune</a> to answer those questions.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following are some notes I&rsquo;m compiling as I&rsquo;m beginning a journey
down the rabbit hole, writing an app in Swift utilizing the <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-13/viper.html">VIPER app development methodology</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had trouble importing nested source code into XCode before realizing that I
needed to import the folder with corresponding Groups. This is done by
clicking the checkbox &ldquo;Create Groups for any Added Folders&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without doing this, the compiler was not able to build the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since there is no way to do method swizzling in Swift, there are no real easy ways to do mocking/stubbing the way we used to do so in Ruby. Instead, this is forcing me to rely on plain old Swift structs. There are some simple ways to stub, but it ends up looking kind of awkward and very wiring-intensive like this:</li>

<li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/teambox/viper-module-generator"><code>vipergen</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/team-supercharge/boa"><code>boa</code></a> scaffolding generators helped me understand the concepts behind the view.</li>
<li>Tip: Build a VIPER module, but don&rsquo;t build it all at once. Just focus on the Presenter-Interactor-Wireframe component, or the DataStore-Entity-Interactor component. This will keep your head from exploding.</li>

<li>xcodebuild + <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty">xcpretty</a> + Guard-shell == some sort of CI feedback loop.</li>
<li>Manually creating mocks in Swift = kind of painful. If you override (subclass) a NSObject in Swift, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30530308/993929">you must provide it with the <code>@objc</code> pragma, otherwise it throws a segfault error</a></li>
<li>You must contact CircleCI manually if you want to activate an iOS build (it&rsquo;s still in beta). What are some other good CI tools to use with iOS?</li>

    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2015/04/30/building-gpx-stats-through-frp-principles-on-bacon-dot-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With my current fascination with <a href="http://github.com/andrewhao/stressfactor">tracking workouts and location-based-activities</a>, I have been interested in how I might be able to rewrite some of my stats logic with FRP principles.</p>

<h3>What is FRP?</h3>

<p>FRP, or Functional Reactive Programming, is often defined as &ldquo;functional programming over values that change over time&rdquo;. It uses functional composition for streams of data that may appear in an infinite stream of data for some far indeterminate future &ndash; these types of use cases are served well by FRP which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">&ldquo;(simplifies) these problems by explicitly modeling time&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h3>GPS &ndash; your location, varied over time.</h3>

<p>A great application of this would be a workout. Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to build an app that received realtime updates on a person&rsquo;s position. Say the app was a Node server that received this JSON blob from a web API as a location update:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">&#39;lat&#39;:</span> <span class="err">29.192414,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;lon&#39;:</span> <span class="err">148.113241,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;ele&#39;:</span> <span class="err">122.1,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;time&#39;:</span> <span class="err">&#39;2015-04-18T13:54:56Z&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say that some time later, the API receives this JSON blob:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">&#39;lat&#39;:</span> <span class="err">29.192424,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;lon&#39;:</span> <span class="err">148.113251,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;ele&#39;:</span> <span class="err">123.1,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;time&#39;:</span> <span class="err">&#39;2015-04-18T13:55:26Z&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we have these data points, that the user has moved <code>+0.00001</code> latitude points and <code>+0.00001</code> longitude points, climbing a total of <code>+1.0</code> meters, over a period of <code>30</code> seconds.</p>

<h4>Exercise: Get my instantaneous velocity</h4>

<p>If we performed this imperatively, we would write it something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With FRP, it might look more like this:</p>

<p>There is a key difference that is not easily demonstrated here &ndash; that the former imperative example requires that all JSON arrays be materialized at once &ndash; via db query, in-memory store, etc. It doesn&rsquo;t account for change in time.</p>

<p>However, the latter functional example accounts for changing values of time as they appear over the stream &ndash; as soon as a new value shows up in the stream, the velocity is changed instantly.</p>

<h3>Some more location-based experiments: rxlocation</h3>

<p>I wrote up a library to parse various facts from a changing stream of GPS events, from instantaneous velocity, average velocity, moving/stopped status, etc.</p>

<p>I investigated different reactive frameworks, mainly <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/">RxJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/">Bacon.js</a>. My takeaways were that RxJS does everything and the kitchen sink, but I got lost trying to reconcile Node streams with RxJS cold streams. Bacon.js just seemed to work for me, out of the box. I&rsquo;m still learning, so I hope to have a better understanding of the core issues here.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-19T13:29:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2015/03/19/docker-rails-and-docker-compose-in-your-development-workflow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This post <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2015/03/17/docker-rails-docker-compose-together-in-your-development-workflow/">originally appeared</a> on the Carbon Five blog.)</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been trialing the usage of Docker and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> (previously known as <a href="http://www.fig.sh">fig</a>) on a Rails project here at Carbon Five. In the past, my personal experience with Docker had been that the promise of portable containerized apps was within reach, but the tooling and development workflow were still awkward &ndash; commands were complex, configuration and linking steps were complicated, and the overall learning curve was high.</p>

<p>My team decided to take a peek at the current landscape of Docker tools (primarily boot2docker and Docker Compose) and see how easily we could spin up a new app and integrate it into our development workflow on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;ve found my experience with Docker tools to be surprisingly pleasant; the tooling easily integrates with existing Rails development workflows with only a minor amount of performance overhead. Docker Compose offers a seamless way to build containers and orchestrate their dependencies, and helps lower the learning curve to build Dockerized applications. Read on to find out how we built ours.</p>

<h2>Introduction to docker-compose (née Fig).</h2>

<p>Docker Compose acts as a wrapper around Docker &ndash; it links your containers together and provides syntactic sugar around some complex container linking commands.</p>

<p>We liked Docker Compose for its ability to coordinate and spin up your entire application and dependencies with one command. In the past, frameworks like Vagrant were easy ways to generate a standard image for your development team to use and get started on. Docker Compose offers similar benefits of decoupling the app from the host environment, but also provides the container vehicle for the app to run in all environments &ndash; that is, the container you develop in will often be the same container that you deploy to production with.</p>

<p>Docker (with the orchestration tooling provided by Compose) provides us the ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade versions of Ruby or Node (or whatever runtime your app requires) in production with far less infrastructure coordination than normally required.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of moving parts in the deployment process. Instead of writing complex Puppet and Capistrano deployment scripts, our deployments will now center around moving images around and starting containers.</li>
<li>Simplify developer onboarding by standardizing your team on the same machine images.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this example, we will run two Docker containers &ndash; a Rails container and a MySQL container &ndash; and rely on Compose to build, link, and run them.</p>

<h2>Installing boot2docker, Docker, and Docker Compose.</h2>

<p>Docker runs in a VirtualBox VM through an image called <code>boot2docker</code>. The reason we have to use <code>boot2docker</code> and VirtualBox is because the Mac OSX filesystem is not compatible with the type of filesystem required to support Docker. Hence, we must run our Docker containers within yet another virtual machine.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Now install boot2docker and Docker Compose.</li>

<h2>Creating a Dockerfile</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a Dockerfile for this app. This specifies the base dependencies for our Rails application. We will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby 2.2 &ndash; for our Rails instance</li>
<li>NodeJS and NPM &ndash; for installation of Karma, jshint, and other JS dependencies.</li>
<li>MySQL client &ndash; for ActiveRecord tasks</li>
<li>PhantomJS &ndash; for executing JS-based tests</li>
<li>vim &ndash; for inspecting and editing files within our container</li>
</ul>


<p>Create a <code>Dockerfile</code> from within your Rails app directory.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s start by breaking this up line-by-line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>FROM ruby:2.2.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#from"><code>FROM</code></a> directive specifies the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ruby/"><code>library/ruby</code> base image from Docker Hub</a>, and uses the <code>2.2.0</code> tag, which corresponds to the Ruby 2.2.0 runtime.</p>

<p>From here on, we are going to be executing commands that will build on this reference image.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>RUN apt-get update -qq <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install -y build-essential nodejs npm nodejs-legacy mysql-client vim
</span><span class='line'>RUN npm install -g phantomjs
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#run"><code>RUN</code></a> command builds up the image, installing specific application dependencies and setting up the environment. Here we install our app dependencies both from <code>apt</code> and <code>npm</code>.</p>

<h3>An aside on how a Docker image is built</h3>

<p>One of the core concepts in Docker is the concept of &ldquo;layers&rdquo;. Docker runs on operating systems that support layering filesystems such as <code>aufs</code> or <code>btrfs</code>. Changes to the filesystem can be thought of as atomic operations that can be rolled forward or backwards.</p>

<p>This means that Docker can effectively store its images as snapshots of each other, much like Git commits. This also has implications as to how we can build up and cache copies of the container as we go along.</p>

<p>The Dockerfile can be thought of as a series of rolling incremental changes to a base image &ndash; each command builds on top of the line before. This allows Docker to quickly rebuild changes to the reference image by understanding which lines have changed &ndash; and not rebuild the image from scratch each time.</p>

<p>Keep these concepts in mind as we talk about speeding up your Docker build in the following section.</p>

<h3>Fast Docker builds by caching your Gemfiles</h3>

<p>The following steps install the required Ruby gems for Bundler, within your app container:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>WORKDIR /tmp
</span><span class='line'>COPY Gemfile Gemfile
</span><span class='line'>COPY Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock
</span><span class='line'>RUN bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note how we sneak the gems into <code>/tmp</code>, then run the <code>bundle install</code> which downloads and installs gems into Bundler&rsquo;s <code>vendor/bundle</code> directory. This is a cache hack &ndash; whereas in the past we would have kept the <code>Gemfile</code>s in with the rest of the application directory in <code>/myapp</code>.</p>

<p>Keeping Gemfiles inline with the app would have meant that the entire <code>bundle install</code> command would have been re-run on each <code>docker-compose build</code> &mdash; without any caching &mdash; due to the constant change in the code in the <code>/myapp</code> directory.</p>

<p>By separating out the Gemfiles into their own directory, we logically separate the Gemfiles, which are far less likely to change, from the app code, which are far more likely to change. This reduces the number of times we have to wait for a clean <code>bundle install</code> to complete.</p>

<p>HT: <a href="http://ilikestuffblog.com/2014/01/06/how-to-skip-bundle-install-when-deploying-a-rails-app-to-docker/">Brian Morearty: &ldquo;How to skip bundle install when deploying a Rails app to Docker&rdquo;</a></p>

<h3>Adding the app</h3>

<p>Finally, we finish our Dockerfile by adding our current app code to the working directory.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ADD . /myapp
</span><span class='line'>WORKDIR /myapp
</span><span class='line'>RUN <span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>production bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rake assets:precompile --trace
</span><span class='line'>CMD <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;rails&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;server&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;-b&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This links the contents of the app directory on the host to the  <code>/myapp</code> directory within the container.</p>

<p>Note that we precompile all our assets before the container boots up &ndash; this ensures that the container is preloaded and ready to run and jives with Docker tenets that a container should be the same container that runs in development, test, and production environments.</p>

<h2>Setting up Docker Compose</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve defined a <code>Dockerfile</code> for booting our Rails app, we turn to the Compose piece that orchestrates the linking phase between the Rails app and its dependencies &ndash; in this case, the DB.</p>

<p>A <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file automatically configures our application ecosystem. Here, it defines our Rails container and its db container:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>

<p>will spin up both the <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> instances.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful tools of using Docker Compose is the ability to abstract away the configuration of your server, no matter whether it is running as a development container on your computer, a test container on CI, or on your production Docker host.</p>

<p>The directive:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">links</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will add an entry for <code>db</code> into the Rails&#8217; container&rsquo;s <code>/etc/hosts</code>, linking the hostname to the correct container. This allows us to write our database.yml like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># config/database.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">development</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="nl">&amp;default</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">host</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another important thing to note is the <code>volumes</code> configuration:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># docker-compose.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">volumes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">.:/myapp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This mounts the current directory <code>.</code> on the host Mac to the <code>/myapp</code> directory in the container. This allows us to make live code changes on the host filesystem and see code changes reflected in the container.</p>

<p>Also note that we make use of Compose&rsquo;s <code>env_file</code> directive, which allows us to specify environment variables to inject into the container at runtime:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">env_file</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&#39;.env.web&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> A peek into <code>.env.web</code> shows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">PORT=3000</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">PUMA_WORKERS=1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIN_THREADS=4</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MAX_THREADS=16</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">SECRET_KEY_BASE=&lt;Rails secret key&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">AWS_REGION=us-west-2</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain"># ...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the <code>env_file</code> is powerful in that it allows us to swap out environment configurations when you deploy and run your containers. Perhaps your container needs separate configurations on dev than when on CI, or when deployed to staging or on production.</p>

<h2>Creating containers and booting them up.</h2>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to assemble the container. From within the Rails app, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose build
</code></pre>

<p>This downloads and builds the containers that your web app and your db will live in, linking them up. You will need to re-run the <code>docker-compose build</code> command every time you change the <code>Dockerfile</code> or <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<h2>Running your app in containers</h2>

<p>You can bring up your Rails server and associated containers by running:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>

<p>This is a combination of build, link, and start-services command for
each container. You should see output that indicates that both our <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> containers, as configured in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, are booting up.</p>

<h2>Development workflow</h2>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to discover that developing with Docker added very little overhead to the development process. In fact, most commands that you would run for Rails simply needed to be prepended with a <code>docker-compose run web</code>.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>When you want to run:           </th>
<th> With Docker Compose, you would run:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>bundle install</code>                </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web bundle install</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rails s</code>                       </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web rails s</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb</code>    </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create</code> </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test web rake db:create</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tail -f log/development.log</code>   </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web tail -f log/development.log</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h2>Protips</h2>

<p>Here are some nice development tricks I found useful when working with Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a <code>dockerhost</code> entry to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so you can visit <code>dockerhost</code> from your browser.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>boot2docker ip
</span><span class='line'>192.168.59.104
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  Then add the IP to your <code>/etc/hosts</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>192.168.59.104  dockerhost
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  Now you can pull up your app from <code>dockerhost:3000</code>:</p>

<p>  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5eqNJqN.png" alt="Screenshot of your URL bar" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Debugging containers with <code>docker exec</code></p>

<p>Sometimes you need to get inside a container to see what&rsquo;s <em>really</em> happening. Perhaps you need to test whether a port is truly open, or verify that a process is truly running. This can be accomplished by grabbing the container ID with a <code>docker ps</code>, then passing that ID into the <code>docker exec</code> command:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>Running an interactive debugger (like <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">pry</a>) in your Docker container</p>

<p>It takes a little extra work to get Docker to allow interactive terminal debugging with tools like <code>byebug</code> or <code>pry</code>. Should you desire to start your web server with debugging capabilities, you will need to use the <code>--service-ports</code> flag with the <code>run</code> command.</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose run --service-ports web
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  This works due to two internal implementations of <code>docker-compose run</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>docker-compose run</code> creates a TTY session for your app to connect to, allowing interactive debugging. The default <code>docker-compose up</code> command does not create a TTY session.</li>
<li><p>The <code>run</code> command does not map ports to the Docker host by default. The <code>--service-ports</code> directive maps the container&rsquo;s ports to the host&rsquo;s ports, allowing you to visit the container from your web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>slim</code> images when possible on production</p></li>
</ul>


<p>  Oftentimes, your base image will come supplied with a <code>-slim</code> variant on Docker Hub. This usually means that the image maintainer has supplied a trimmed-down version of the container for you to use with source code and build-time files stripped and removed. You can oftentimes shave a couple hundred megabytes off your resulting image &mdash; we did when we switched our <code>ruby</code> image from <code>2.2.1</code> to <code>2.2.1-slim</code>. This results in faster deployment times due to less network I/O from the registry to the deployment target.</p>

<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Remember that your app runs in containers &ndash; so every time you do a <code>docker-compose run</code>, remember that Compose is spinning up entirely new containers for your code <strong>but only if the containers are not up already, in which case they are linked to that (running) container</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve spun up multiple instances of your app without thinking about it &ndash; for example, you may have a <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> container already up from a <code>docker-compose up</code> command, and then in a separate terminal window you run a <code>docker-compose run web rails c</code>. That spins up <em>another</em> <code>web</code> container to execute the command, but then links that container with the pre-launched <code>db</code> container.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a small but noticeable performance penalty running through both the VirtualBox VM and docker. I&rsquo;ve generally noticed waiting a few extra seconds when starting a Rails environment. My overall experience has been that the penalty has not been large enough to be painful.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Out of <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/storybook">Storybook</a>, a side project I&rsquo;ve been doing for a friend, I had the opportunity to model the problem domain as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). It goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>A set of students are assigned a book a week. Write plan generator to create a set of student-book assignments for that week, given the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>All students must receive a book.</li>
<li>Each book may only be assigned to one student at a time.</li>
<li>A student may not be assigned a book s/he has received before.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Being that this was a Rails app, I put <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/storybook">Amb</a>, a Ruby-based CSP solver, to use. Amb is derived off <a href="">Jim Weirich&rsquo;s original source code</a>, implementing a simple backtracking algorithm. (More <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?amb">interesting reading on the original idea</a> behind the <code>amb</code> operator, proposed in a <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/basis1.pdf">paper</a> by LISP founder John McCarthy in 1963.)</p>

<p>Not having written any CSP logic since my university days, I tried to come up with a naive solution. It goes something like this:</p>

<p>Well this would work for 2 students and 2 bags, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, but would blow up and overflow the stack when we got to 5 students and 5 bags. Why? I was forcing Ruby to generate the full solution space before starting the CSP search problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">student_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:s1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:s2</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">bag_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:b1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:b2</span><span class="o">]</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I was taking that cross product and brute-force generating all possible permutations internal to that:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">spaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">permutation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">student_ids</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_a</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; [[[:s1, :b1], [:s1, :b2]], [[:s1, :b1], [:s2, :b1]],</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s1, :b2], [:s2, :b1]], [[:s1, :b2], [:s2, :b2]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s2, :b1], [:s1, :b1]], [[:s2, :b1], [:s1, :b2]],</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The most obvious thing that stood out to me like a sore thumb was how I wasn&rsquo;t simply trusting the constraint-based nature of the problem and expressing the problem in terms of the constraints, instead of attempting to imperatively generate the solution. Usage of <code>Enumerable#permutation</code> resulted in an <em>O(n!)</em> algorithm, which is unacceptable. Back to the drawing board:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note the main difference here is how I&rsquo;ve re-tooled the solver to assign variables one at a time (in L5) and check constraints after each assignment. This simplifies the domain of the problem as a graph search and helps us more easily reason about this program.</p>

<h3>Further explorations</h3>

<p>Follow my <a href="https://www.github.com/andrewhao/csp-solvers/">csp-solvers</a> project, where I attempt to rewrite this in Prolog and Clojure in an attempt to see how language affects how we reason about problems like these. It&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>

    <updated>2014-11-15T10:03:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/11/15/my-own-robot-training-buddy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an ultra runner, I am really into the mountains. As a software engineer, I&rsquo;m really into data. So naturally, I&rsquo;m interested in the intersection of both.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve particularly been interested in how systems like <a href="http://www.strava.com">Strava</a> work, especially when they quantify what is known as a &ldquo;Suffer Score&rdquo;, a single number denoting the amount of training stress (a.k.a. suffering) you put yourself through in a workout.</p>

<p>How does a track workout compare to a long day on the trails? Which is tougher: a 5m tempo road run in and around my neighborhood, or a tough 2m climb into a local regional park?</p>

<h2>Data in&hellip;</h2>

<p>I first attacked the problem of getting data off of my phone. I record my GPX tracks in <a href="http://runmeter.com/">Runmeter</a>, a fantastic iPhone application with all sorts of metrics and data export capabilities. What I wanted was a seamless way to get the data off my phone without fuss after a hard workout.</p>

<p>The application has a nifty feature in which it can automatically send an email to an email address after a workout is completed.</p>

<p>I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/velocitas">email ingester, Velocitas</a>, with the help of <a href="http://cloudmailin.com/">Cloudmailin</a>, which fires off a POST request to the Node application. Velocitas does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>curl</code>s and downloads the GPX link embedded in the email.</li>
<li>Saves the GPX file to a linked Dropbox account.</li>
<li>Republishes the GPX file to a linked Strava account.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Deriving the Training Stress Score</h2>

<p>Next up: I wanted to do a quick and dirty implementation of the (run-based) Training Stress Score. <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/stressfactor">Stressfactor</a>, a Ruby gem, is what came out of it.</p>

<p>It implements the rTSS as detailed in <a href="http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/running-training-stress-score-rtss-explained">this article</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">duration_seconds</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">normalized_graded_pace</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">intensity_factor</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">functional_threshold_pace</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3600</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">100</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Stressfactor is a higher-order tookit for deriving meaning from GPX tracks, so it, at the moment, attempts to calculate the stress score and grade adjusted pace.</p>

<p>The data still needs validation, so I&rsquo;m eager to run it on my data set of GPX tracks from the past years.</p>

<h2>Generating reports</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on this part right now &mdash; I need to nicely display a report from my workout history in Dropbox and display per-GPX. I&rsquo;ve started the project &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/stressreport">Stressreport</a>.</p>

<h2>Some things I&rsquo;ve learned and am learning</h2>

<ul>
<li>The human body is complex, and cannot be <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Modeling_Human_Performance">easily modeled</a> without sufficient data. That said, what I&rsquo;m doing now may be sufficient for basic training data.</li>
<li>The nature of parsing and generating higher-order stats from raw data may lend itself well to experimentation with functional languages. I&rsquo;m interested in trying to reimplement Stressfactor in Scala, or a functional equivalent.</li>
<li>Deploying all my apps on Heroku&rsquo;s free tier may actually be an interesting start to building a microservice architecture &mdash; with the space limitations on Heroku, I&rsquo;m forced to build new features on new services. Call it cheapskate architecture.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blurb sent me off to QCon SF 2014 for three days.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I took a series of notes each day in attendance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/notes/2014-11-03-qconsf-day-one.html">Day One: Architectures, Functional</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/notes/2014-11-04-qconsf-day-two.html">Day Two: Rx Systems, API Platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/notes/2014-11-05-qconsf-day-three.html">Day Three: Microservices, Culture</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Big trends in continuous delivery and deployment &mdash; deploy more often, smaller feedback loops</li>
<li>A lot of emphasis on event driven architectures + microservices. Lots of emphasis on DDD as a design tool.</li>
<li>Reactive systems with functional implementations were widely discussed as a scaling tool (backpressure-sensitive) and as a coordination tool between multiple async services.</li>
<li>Big data/realtime streaming talks were interesting &mdash; my personal experience with them is limited, but it seems there is a debate over the merits of existing Lambda architecture practice.</li>
<li>A lot of talk about microservice orchestration tools &mdash; acknowledging the pain of configuration and management of many services.</li>
<li>Scala got a lotttt of attention. Probably because of its presence in bigger companies like Netflix, Twitter, LinkedIn. Wonder what smaller startups are using.</li>
<li>Web Components were a big upcoming trend in frontend technologies. Strong modularization of views + behaviors in HTML documents.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If I could do a startup over again, would I begin an app in Rails? Where is the sweet spot for that sort of application architecture?</li>
<li>How can I design systems such that they can be extractible into focused components/services as early as possible?</li>
<li>How can we plan for failures (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection">fault injection</a>)?</li>
<li>How does one implement change in software engineering organizations? Bottom-up (organic initiatives bubbling up through management) vs top-down (management/software leaders direct org to implement).</li>
<li>How are we doing with encouraging women and minorities who traditionally are underrepresented in our industry?</li>
<li>What are places in our hiring funnels that, unbeknownst to us, may be turning away or detracting women and minorities?</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-11-01T18:38:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/11/01/conways-law-for-humans</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a>, it states:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&rsquo;s communication structure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or in layman&rsquo;s terms, your software systems reflect the structure of the teams that create them.</p>

<p>Think about it &mdash; do your teams prefer to do everything themselves? Or do they ask for help from other teams? In general, as a team, we prefer to have as little dependencies as possible. The work that the engineer has to do to send an email, or wait for work from another team (like an API change or design change) is usually time-consuming and burdensome. Therefore, it is not (usually) in the team&rsquo;s best interests to cross silos and ask for help from others. Your teams, if they look like this, tend to work in codebases that are generally monolithic and wholly owned by the team.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong, or it&rsquo;s not bad, it&rsquo;s just a sociological observation. This is why companies like Spotify, Netflix or Amazon have embraced Conway&rsquo;s Law and changed their organizations to match the  microservice-driven architecture they want. Small teams work on small codebases and are empowered to make the changes they need.</p>

<h3>A corollary and some observations about your company culture.</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a corollary, which I&rsquo;ve heard in various shapes and forms. Paraphrased:</p>

<blockquote><p>An organization&rsquo;s structure tends to pattern after its leaders&#8217; communication patterns.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been pushing an effort to unify our company&rsquo;s frontend styles and UX into a unified framework in an attempt to standardize the look and feel of the site.</p>

<p>However, in working with our designers, I realized that they weren&rsquo;t talking to each other. Designers in one department had opposing design aesthetics from designers in another. This was causing problems in the code, because the frontend framework itself was becoming fragmented. You could see it in the code. Version A of the styleguide went into Department A&rsquo;s products. Version B of the styleguide went to Department B&rsquo;s products.</p>

<p>In this case, as we kept rolling out this framework, I realized our organization had no single owner for the design language of the site. Why? I had to wonder if it had to do with some deeper communication issues between the heads of the two departments.</p>

<p>Code can be a good canary to organizational issues, and call out larger human issues at hand. In this case, Conway&rsquo;s Law helps us root out and bring into the light structural concerns. Leaders can pay attention to these concerns and check themselves to become more open communicators.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the famed &ldquo;TDD is dead&rdquo; debate around the Rails community largely
coming to an end, I found myself referencing Martin Fowler&rsquo;s article,
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren&rsquo;t Stubs</a> a good deal, trying to make sense of it in terms of how I write tests and code.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to talk about mocking and stubbing and their
roots, paraphrase Fowler in an attempt to explain their differences, and
walk through a couple of code examples. In each case, I&rsquo;m going to
attempt to build this example out in Ruby and RSpec 3.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume this implementation in our code for a <code>BookUpdater</code> object in Ruby. Its job is to call through its collaborating <code>ApiClient</code>, which wraps some aspect of an API that we want to call.</p>

<h2>What they are</h2>

<h3>Mocks</h3>

<p>Mocks are fake objects that verify that they have received messages. In
RSpec, we traditionally use the <code>mock</code> object utility to create these objects.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening here? RSpec creates a mock <code>api_client</code> object that will verify that, after the test case executes, it has received the <code>:call_update_api</code> message with the correct arguments.</p>

<p>The main point of this style of testing is <em>behavior verification</em> &mdash; that is, that your object is behaving correctly in relation with its collaborators.</p>

<h3>Double</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a <code>double</code> &mdash; also known as a <code>stub</code>. A <code>double</code> is a fake object that is set up to respond to a certain message with a pre-canned response, each time. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how I would set up a test using doubles:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">api_client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;api client&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;response&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:success?</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">allow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">api_client</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:call_update_api</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update!</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">change</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:updated?</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s the big deal here? My test case still passes. Note that
I had to change my code to focus its expectation on the <code>subject</code>&rsquo;s
state instead of the <code>api_client</code>.</p>

<p>The focus of using doubles is for <em>state verification</em> &mdash; that is, that so long as everybody around me is behaving according to their contracts, the test merely has to verify that internal object state changes correctly.</p>

<h3>A third way &mdash; real objects</h3>

<p>I won&rsquo;t cover this very much in depth, but with sufficiently simple objects, one could actually instantiate real objects instead of doubles, and test an object against all its collaborators. This is, in my experience, the most common experience of working in Rails + ActiveRecord applications.</p>

<h2>Classic vs Mockist testing: different strokes for different folks</h2>

<p>As we saw above, the key difference between the mock and the stub (the <code>double</code>). The focus of the test in the mock case is on the messages being sent to the collaborators. The focus of the test when using the double is on the the <code>subject</code> under test (SUT).</p>

<p>Mocks and stubs/doubles are tools that we can use under the larger umbrellas of two TDD philosophical styles: <em>classic</em> vs <em>mockist</em> styles.</p>

<h3>Classic TDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Classic TDDists like using <code>double</code>s or real objects to test collaborators.</li>
<li>From personal experience, testing classicly is oftentimes the path of least resistance. There isn&rsquo;t expectation setup and verification that mockist testing requires of you.</li>
<li>Classic TDD sometimes results in creating objects that reveal state &mdash; note how the <code>BookUpdater</code> needed to expose an <code>updated?</code> method.</li>
<li>Setting up the state of the world prior to your test may be complex, requiring setting up all the objects in your universe. This can be a huge pain (has anybody ever had this problem with overcomplicated Rails models with spidery associations? Raise your hands&hellip;). Classicists may argue that the root cause here is not paying attention to your model architecture, and having too many associations is an antipattern. Alternatively, classicists oftentimes generate test factories (e.g. Rails&#8217; FactoryGirl gem) to manage test setup.</li>
<li>Tests tend to be treatable more like black boxes, testable under isolation (due to verifications on object state) and are more resistant to refactoring.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mockist TDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mockist TDD utilizes <code>mock</code>s to verify behavior between objects and collaborators.</li>
<li>It can be argued to develop &ldquo;purer&rdquo; objects, that are mainly concerned with objects passing messages to each other. Fowler refers to these objects as preferring role-interfaces.</li>
<li>These tests are easier to set up, as they don&rsquo;t require setting up the state of the world prior to test invocation.</li>
<li>Tests tend to be more coupled to implementation, and may be more difficult to refactor due to very specific requirements for message passing between collaborators.</li>
<li>Fowler brings up a point where being a mockist means that your objects prefer to <a href="https://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">Tell Don&rsquo;t Ask</a>. A nice side effect of TDA is you generally can avoid Demeter violations.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>In coming from a classic TDD background, I&rsquo;ve oftentimes viewed mockist testing with some suspicion, particularly around how much work is involved to bring them about. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve warmed up to the usage of mockist testing, but have not been diligent enough at doing pure driving TDD with mocks. In reviewing Fowler&rsquo;s comments, I&rsquo;m intruiged at the possibilities of mockist TDD in affecting system design, particularly in their natural inclinations toward <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html">role interfaces</a>. I look forward to trying pure mockist TDD in a future project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In one of my personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/chordmeister">Chordmeister</a>), I&rsquo;ve been trying to
upgrade the code to be written in <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules#export_declarations">ES6 modules</a> and transpile down to AMD modules with Square&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/square/es6-module-transpiler">very excellent es6-module-transpiler project</a>.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve already <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/hendrix">updated</a> an Ember app of mine to try ES6, I figured it was high time to do it on another project.</p>

<h2>Sorry Coffeescript, but I&rsquo;m moving on.</h2>

<p>First problem: Coffeescript seems indecisive with respect to ES6
support. In order to support <code>import</code> or <code>export</code> keywords, I had to
wrap the statements in backticks, making the code look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coffeescript'><span class='line'><span class="o">`</span><span class="nx">import</span> <span class="nx">ClassifiedLine</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s">&quot;chordmeister/classified_line&quot;</span><span class="o">`</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nx">Parser</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">`</span><span class="nx">export</span> <span class="nx">default</span> <span class="nx">Parser</span><span class="o">`</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Except this wasn&rsquo;t being picked up by es6-module-transpiler, since
Coffeescript wraps the entire declaration in a closure: I was
finding myself having problems compiling from Coffeescript &ndash;> ES5 JS &ndash;> ES6 JS.</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So the first call: ditch Coffeescript. Write this in pure ES6.</p>

<h2>Next up: adding AMD support in Mocha</h2>

<p>Okay, so we need to set up a few things to get Mocha playing well with RequireJS, the AMD loader.</p>

<p>Our plan of attach will be to leverage the generated AMD modules and load our tests up with them. We have the benefit of being able to specifically inject dependencies into our test suite.</p>

<p>The tricky parts will be:</p>

<h3>Set up the Mocha index.html runner</h3>

<p>Install <code>mocha</code>, <code>require.js</code>, and <code>chai</code> via <code>bower</code>, then plug them into the harness:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that I was having synchonicity issues between spec suite load and <code>mocha.run()</code>. Throwing everything back a few hundred ms seemed to have done the fix.</p>

<h2>AMD gotchas</h2>

<p>Pay attention to the <code>default</code> parameter that the module exports with. This is important to remember since native ES6 will allow you to directly import it with its native syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">Parser</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="s2">&quot;chordmeister/parser&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But if you&rsquo;re using RequireJS/AMD modules, you&rsquo;ll need to explicitly call out the <code>default</code> namespace from the required module, so like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <link href="http://www.g9labs.com/2014/04/26/implementing-ddd-chapter-2/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-26T08:43:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/04/26/implementing-ddd-chapter-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Chapter 2: Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts</h2>

<p>A <em>Domain</em> is what a business does and the surrounding context of how it does business. It is important to model out its supported <em>Subdomains</em> &mdash; that is, the smaller components of the business that collaborate in real, day-to-day operations of the business. The book describes these as <em>Core Domains</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, a <em>Bounded Context</em> is the physical manifestation of the solution space as software &mdash; models living in a real application. Its key feature in the context of DDD is as a linguistic barrier between different domains.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, each <em>Subdomain</em> maps directly to one <em>Bounded Context</em>. In the real world, this is less common since we tend to build things into monolithic systems. Still &mdash; many monolithic applications have several components that could in themselves be bounded contexts.</p>

<h6>Side note: In Rails, one could think of Engines as a <em>Bounded Context</em>. But that might be a blog post for another time.</h6>

<p>It is important to get these ideas and concepts down correctly because we need correct modeling of our systems to determine what they do.</p>

<h3>Bounded Contexts and terms</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not usually realistic to get the entire organization agreeing on a universal linguistic definition for every term. Instead, DDD assumes that different terms have different meanings in different contexts.</p>

<p>The author then dives into the an example of a book, where a <em>book</em> means several different things to different people in different contexts. A book is touched upon by authors, graphic designers, editors, marketing folks. In each of these contexts, the features of a book mean different things at different times. It is impossible to develop an all-knowing Book model without disagreement between stakeholders. DDD, instead, acknowledges these differences and allows stakeholders to use linguistic terms from within their unique Bounded Contexts.</p>

<p>Bounded Contexts may include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object models</li>
<li>A database schema / persistence layer</li>
<li>A SOAP or REST API</li>
<li>A user interface</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bounded context antipatterns</h3>

<p>You may be tempted to divide up a bounded context by architectural concerns, or because you want to assign smaller tasks to developers (resource allocation). Beware that this kind of work tends to fragment the language.</p>

<p>DDD operates on <em>linquistic drivers</em>. The unity, cohesion and domain-adherence of the bounded context should be the first priority in the design.</p>

<p>Assigning two teams to the same bounded context results in fragmentation of the bounded context.</p>

<p>Ideally: we strive to assign one team to work on one Bounded Context with one Ubiquitous Language at a time.</p>

<h6>In Rails, what are the bounded contexts? It could be the top-level Rails application, or an engine, or a gem, that define the context boundaries._</h6>

<h3>A story&hellip;</h3>

<p>The chapter then goes on to describe their fictional team designing through three iterations off their DDD strategy:</p>

<p>A system in which all domains live within the same bounded context. They see the folly of this and refactor with some tactical patterns, like creating services.</p>

<p>This is, however, missing the point. They realized they needed to listen to business and their domain experts to find out exactly where the right places were to segregate the contexts. The team discovers that the business has a desire to go in a new direction which allows them to segregate the domain in such a way that would enable future directions for the business.</p>

<h6>How often are we as developers in conversation with our product owners and asking where the business <em>wants</em> to go in the future?</h6>

<p>Conversations with the business reveal an intention to develop an add-on product to the core product. This implies the development of two subdomains. However, further investigation reveals that the shared overlap of certain domain models (like users, roles, and access management) cannot simply be identically shared between two systems, since their <em>linguistic meanings</em> in the two systems differ slightly. Instead, the developers use the linguistic problem to develop a third bounded context.</p>

<p>The developers separate their app into three bounded contexts built as three software systems.</p>

    <link href="http://www.g9labs.com/2014/03/08/six-months-as-a-manager/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-08T16:15:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/03/08/six-months-as-a-manager</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been approximately six months since I&rsquo;ve entered engineering management. Here are some thoughts reflecting back on that season now.</p>

<h2>I didn&rsquo;t like it at first.</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: I didn&rsquo;t like the feeling of being a &ldquo;manager&rdquo; now. It comes with too much baggage of pointy-haired bosses or ineffective waste layers. Why do we need managers anyways?</p>

<p>More to the point: I love coding. I love working on rewarding projects. I hated the thought of being tied up in meetings while day by day getting more and more disconnected from code.</p>

<p>So I struggled a lot in those first few months (still do), trying to maintain the balance of working with product management to get a strategic vision communicated, or with other engineering teams to get a tactical vision in place, versus trying to be deeply involved with the code base and doing code reviews.</p>

<h3>You can&rsquo;t code anymore.</h3>

<p>In the end? I had to come to grips with the reality that my team needed me in a different role &mdash; a strategic role, helping them see the big picture, sniffing out dependencies and destroying blockers before they got to them.</p>

<p>But I still needed to be spot-on with the code &mdash; I still needed to be in the know with new product features as they are being developed. So it&rsquo;s my priority to be in design discussions, but I can&rsquo;t be the implementer anymore.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve started a change in mindset &mdash; how can offload all the random codebase knowledge I&rsquo;ve acquired over the years to the team? How can I effectively share my expertise so I&rsquo;m out of a (coding) job? I&rsquo;m starting to be more convinced that the answer to that is pair programming.</p>

<h3>Pairing your way out of a job</h3>

<p>Nowadays if there&rsquo;s a story or task in which I am the only one (or one of few) with domain knowledge about the feature, I&rsquo;ll ask a team member to pair with me on the feature. That way we get a really effective teaching tool about the domain model, and the extra plus in that if I get pulled into a meeting, development can continue.</p>

<h3>But you still have to code.</h3>

<p>So I code on the weekends (not everybody can do this!)</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re a Rails team taking on a new Ember project. I need to get my chops up around Ember so I&rsquo;ve decided to pull in a <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/hendrix">side project</a> to hack on the weekends. My side work on <a href="http://www.wejoinin.com">Wejoinin</a> lets me do all the Rails things I don&rsquo;t get to do anymore at work.</p>

<p>And it works for me because I love to code, and to be honest, I don&rsquo;t ever want to get weak in that area.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;d love more feedback from other engineering managers in that area. How do you keep your chops sharp?</p>

<h3>People are your priority.</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read often that <a href="http://firstround.com/article/My-Management-Lessons-from-Three-Failed-Startups-Google-Apple-Dropbox-Twitter-and-Square">empathy is everything</a> when it comes to management, and it still rings true. No matter how this product launch goes, in the end your team will remember how you treated them, how their thoughts and feelings were taken into account.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;m trying to check myself is my tendency to jump in on other people&rsquo;s sentences and cut them off. It sounds silly, but sometimes I realize I like to talk a lot more than listen. As a manager, sometimes you need to dwell on the feedback of a team member for some time before you write it off. There&rsquo;s usually a core message in there that&rsquo;s completely valid &mdash; a frustration, a desire for change. Empathy means communicating the message: &ldquo;I heard you, and I respect your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s your attitude</h3>

<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s what I think: your attitude toward your company and the team make <em>ALL</em> the difference.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is your orientation truly to support your team? How will it be clear in the long run that your supported someone in their career?</li>
<li>Where are places in your workday where you can connect and sympathize with people &mdash; share a joke, listen to someone&rsquo;s frustration, or just simply go out to lunch?</li>
<li>How are you giving people something to work toward to: a vision of changing the world (for Blurb, it&rsquo;s about transforming the publishing industry).</li>
<li>How are you addressing negativity? Grumbling is important to address head on in its own space, but how are you empowering people to take charge of issues of culture or organizational friction?</li>
<li>How are you checking your own negativity &mdash; sometimes we forget that we&rsquo;re the solutions to our own problems, and I&rsquo;ve found oftentimes that the very issues that you assume are impossible to change are crackable by having the right relationships with the right people.</li>
</ul>


<p>The little things matter.</p>

<h3>Growth areas</h3>

<p>Lord knows I have a lot to learn here. One area I&rsquo;m learning to grow in is how to give honest and accurate feedback to team members, without fearing how they&rsquo;re going to receive it.</p>

<p>Another area? Delegation. I&rsquo;m learning to delegate the little micro-responsibilities in my job that I just kind of expect that I&rsquo;m supposed to do. Case in point: every week we accept a translation import from a third-party translation service. I realized that I was burning a lot of time reviewing hundreds of lines of translation keys every week, and the repetition of it was sapping a lot of my energy. I had to learn to ask a team member for help and give them responsibility to own that function of the process.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-02T11:31:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/02/02/blogging-through-implementing-domain-driven-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent conversations with coworkers, the topic of Domain-Driven Design has
arisen on more than a few occasions in design and architecture meetings.
&ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo; a coworker asked, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d help us a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten my hands on a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing Domain-Driven Design</a>
by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/">Vaughn Vernon</a>, which is a more pragmatic
approach to DDD than the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y">Domain-Driven Design</a> book by Eric Evans.</p>

<p>My desire is to share my outlines of the book chapter-by-chapter,
hopefully once a week.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Getting Started with DDD</h2>

<h3>Can I DDD?</h3>

<ul>
<li>DDD helps us design software models where &ldquo;our design is exactly how
the software works&rdquo; (1).</li>
<li>DDD isn&rsquo;t a technology, it&rsquo;s a set of principles that involve
discussion, listening, and business value so you can <em>centralize
knowledge</em>.</li>
<li>The main principle here is that we must &ldquo;understand the business in
which our software works&rdquo; (3). This means we learn from domain experts
in our field.</li>
<li>What is a domain model? an object model where objects have
data/persistence concerns with an accurate business meaning.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why You Should Do DDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Domain experts and devs on same playing field, cooperation required as
one team. (Agile teams, anyone?)</li>
<li>The business can learn more about itself through the questions asked
about itself.</li>
<li>Knowledge is centralized.</li>
<li>Zero translations between domain experts and software devs and
software.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The design is the code, and code is the design.&rdquo; (7)</li>
<li>It is not without up-front cost</li>
</ul>


<h4>The problem</h4>

<ul>
<li>The schism between business domain experts and software developers
puts your project (and your business) at a risk.</li>
<li>The more time passes, the greater the divide grows.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Solution</h4>

<ul>
<li>DDD brings domain experts and software developers together to develop
software that reflects the business domain mental model.</li>
<li>Oftentimes this requires that they jointly develop a &ldquo;Ubiquitous
Language&rdquo; &ndash; a shared vocabulary and set of concepts that are jointly
spoken by everybody.</li>
<li>DDD produces software that is better designed &amp; architected &ndash;> better testable &ndash;>
clearer code.</li>
<li>Take heed: DDD should only be used to simplify your domain. If the net
cost of implementing DDD is only going to add complexity, then you
should stay away.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Domain model health</h4>

<ul>
<li>As time passes, our domain models can become
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">anemic</a>,
and lose their expressive capabilities and clean boundaries. This can
lead to spaghetti code and a violation of object responsibilities.</li>
<li>Why do anemic domain models hurt us? They claim to be well-formed
models but they hide a badly designed system that is still unfocused
in what it does. (Andrew: I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Service objects that
claim to be services but really are long scripts to get things done.
There might be a cost of designing the Service interface, but inside
things are just as messy as before we got there.)</li>
<li>Seems like Vernon is blaming the influence of IDEs for Visual Basic as
they influenced Java libraries &mdash; too many explicit getters and
setters.</li>
<li>Vernon throws up some code samples comparing two different code
samples &mdash; one with an anemic model that looks like a long string of
commands and another with descriptive method names. He makes the case
that simply reading the code is documentation of the domain itself.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How to do DDD</h4>

<ul>
<li>Have a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"><em>Ubiquitous Language</em></a>
where the team of domain experts share the language together, from
domain experts to programmers.</li>
<li><p>Steps to coming up with a language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Draw out the domain and label it.</li>
<li>Make a glossary of terms and definitions.</li>
<li>Have the team review the language document.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Note that a Ubiquitous Language is specific to the context it is
implemented in. In other words, there is one Ubiquitous Language per
Bounded Context.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Business value of DDD</h3>

<ol>
<li>The organization gains a useful model of its domain</li>
<li>The precise definition of the business is developed</li>
<li>Domain experts contribute to software design.</li>
<li>A better user experience is gained.</li>
<li>Clean boundaries for models keep them pure.</li>
<li>Enterprise architecture is better designed.</li>
<li>Continuous modeling is used &mdash; the working software we produce is the
model we worked so hard to create.</li>
<li>New tools and patterns are used.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
<li>The time and effort required to think about the busines domain,
research concepts, and converse with domain experts.</li>
<li>It may be hard to get a domain expert involved due to their
availability.</li>
<li>There is a lot of thought required to clarify pure models and do
domain modeling.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Tactical modeling</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Core Domain</em> is the part of your application that has key and
important business value &mdash; and may require high thought and attention
to design.</li>
<li>Sometimes DDD may not be the right fit for you &mdash; if you have a lot of
experienced developers who are very comfortable with domain modeling,
you may be better off trusting their opinion.</li>
</ul>


<h4>DDD is not heavy.</h4>

<ul>
<li>It fits into any Agile or XP framework. It leans into TDD, eg: you use
TDD to develop a new domain model that describes how it interacts with
other existing models. You go through the red-green-refactor cycle.</li>
<li>DDD promotes lightweight development. As domain experts read the code, they
are able to provide in-flight feedback to the development of the
system.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://www.g9labs.com/2014/01/26/moving-to-ember-app-kit/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-26T23:32:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2014/01/26/moving-to-ember-app-kit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a bit of the buzz around <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit">Ember App Kit</a>
recently and decided to move Hendrix, my music management app, over from
a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>-generated Ember app to EAK with all its
bells and whistles.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference?</h3>

<p>Well on the surface, the two frameworks aren&rsquo;t very different. The
standard Yeoman build tool sets you up with Grunt and Bower, which is
what EAK provides you out of the box. The cool stuff happens when you
dive under the hood: ES6 module transpilation and an AMD-compatible
Ember Resolver, built-in Karma integration and a built-in API stub
framework for development and test environments.</p>

<h3>The joys of modules</h3>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realize was that compiling to ES6 modules required that my
filenames be renamed exactly how the modules were going to be placed,
with the extra caveat that resource actions needed to live in their own
directories. Recall that in the old way of doing things with globals and
namespaces, you could get away with throwing a route file like this in
your app directory:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>routes/
</span><span class='line'>  songs_index_controller.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And inside:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">MyApp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">SongsIndexRoute</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Route</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">//...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In EAK&rsquo;s world, you need to nest the file under the <code>songs/</code> directory,
and strip the type from the filename, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">routes</span><span class="o">/</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">songs</span><span class="o">/</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">index</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">js</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Inside the file, you assign the function to a variable and let it be
exported in the default namespace.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">SongsIndexRoute</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Route</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">//...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kr">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">SongsIndexRoute</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>File name matters</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-jj-abrams-resolver/">new Ember resolver</a>
loads modules in a smart way &mdash; according to how the framework
structures resources, controllers and their corresponding actions. So
visiting <code>#/songs</code> from my app caused the app to look up and load
<code>appkit/routes/songs/index</code>. What I didn&rsquo;t realize was <em>this module must
live at a very specific place in the file directory structure</em>.
I realized that I left the module type in the file name the first time
around, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are no types in the module names &mdash; or the filenames, for that
matter. I had not realized this (I&rsquo;m also an AMD newbie) &mdash; so I had
left my files un-renamed as <code>songs_index_route</code>, which meant that
the module loader had stored the SongsIndexRoute module under
<code>appkit/routes/songs/index_route</code>, but was doing a route lookup through
the Resolver for: <code>appkit/routes/songs/index</code>. Renaming the file to:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/"><code>$.ajaxSetup</code></a>, though its
usage is not recommended, is designed to set global options on the
jQuery <code>ajax</code> object. It provides some information on the options you can modify.</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Ember support this out of the box? I think it&rsquo;s because they
cannot support IE, where one must use an XDR object to support CORS.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve posted an <a href="http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-data-and-cors/3690">Ember follow-up question in the
forums</a> for discussion.</p>

<h2>Get Rails talking JSON out of its mimetype confusion.</h2>

<p>Did you know that if you rely on the <code>Accepts:</code> header in HTTP that
Rails does not obey its ordering<code>*</code>? I was trying to figure out why my
Rails controllers were trying to render HTML instead of JSON when the
headers were:</p>

<p><code>'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01'</code></p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9940">very long winded
discussion</a> on the Rails
project reveals that, well, nobody has it figured out yet. Most modern
browsers do obey <code>Accepts:</code> specificity, but for the sake of older
browser compatibility, the best practice for browsers is still to return
HTML when <code>*/*</code> is specified.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rails developers who want to use <code>Accepts:</code>
mimetype lists? Well, we either wait for the Rails projects to support
mimetype specificity (and for older browsers to die out), or we are
encouraged to include the format explicitly in the URI.</p>

<p>I chose to have Ember append the <code>.json</code> suffix to the URL, thanks to
this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13648807/ds-model-url-not-working-in-ember-js">SO
post</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Heard an awesome Ruby Rogues podcast recently: <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/083-rr-decomposing-fat-models-with-bryan-helmkamp/">&ldquo;Decomposing Fat Models&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, they&rsquo;re talking through Bryan Helmkamp&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/">Code Climate blog entry &ldquo;7 ways to decompose fat ActiveRecord models&rdquo;</a>, which sums up a few strategies that mainly involve extracting objects from your existing code, value, service, policy, decorator objects and the like. Give the entry a read-through, it&rsquo;s opened my eyes a lot to rethinking my architecture of my Rails models.</p>

<p>A few interesting thoughts that came up in the podcast:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The &ldquo;Skinny Controller, Fat Model&rdquo; mantra has hurt the Rails community because we start getting these bloated AR classes. &ldquo;&lsquo;fat-&rsquo; anything is bad&rdquo; one of the hosts mentions in the blog. The smaller your models, the more manageable, readable and testable they become.</p></li>
<li><p>Rubyists don&rsquo;t like the term &ldquo;Factory&rdquo;, even though in Helmkamp&rsquo;s opinion, Ruby classes <em>are</em> factories. &ldquo;We call them &#8220;builders&rdquo;&ldquo; one of the hosts jokes.</p></li>
<li><p>The Open/Closed Principle as applied to Ruby: using delegators, decorators.</p></li>
</ul>

    <id>http://www.g9labs.com/2012/10/04/deploying-janky-on-ubuntu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/1013-janky">Janky</a> is a Github-developed <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">Hubot</a> + Jenkins control interface. It&rsquo;s developed to be deployed on Heroku. However, what if you need it to live on an internal VM? Here&rsquo;s how I got it running on a Ubuntu (12.04 Precise) VM.</p>

<h2>Make sure you have the correct MySQL libs installed:</h2>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
</code></pre>

<h2>Clone janky from the <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Github repository</a></h2>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/github/janky.git
cd janky
</code></pre>

<h2>Bootstrap your environment</h2>

<p>The following steps are taken nearly verbatim from the &ldquo;Hacking&rdquo; section on the Janky README:</p>

<pre><code>script/bootstrap

mysqladmin -uroot create janky_development
mysqladmin -uroot create janky_test

RACK_ENV=development bin/rake db:migrate
RACK_ENV=test bin/rake db:migrate

RACK_ENV=development bundle exec rake db:seed
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure Thin</h2>

<p>Open <code>Gemfile</code> in your text editor and add:</p>

<pre><code>gem "foreman"
</code></pre>

<p>Then install it:</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a Procfile:</p>

<pre><code>touch Procfile
</code></pre>

<p>Open the Procfile in your text editor and add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>web: bundle exec thin start -p $PORT
</code></pre>

<p>Add the JANKY_* variables to your environment according to the janky README. I use zsh, so I added these as export statements in my ~/.zshenv</p>

<h2>Start your server</h2>

<pre><code>bundle exec foreman start
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the server starts on port 5000 by default, and you can override it like so:</p>

<pre><code>PORT=8080 bundle exec foreman start
</code></pre>

<h2>That&rsquo;s it!</h2>

<p>Let me know how that works for you!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been hitting a lot of &ldquo;Maximum file limit exceeded&rdquo; dialogs after a long day at work &mdash; at any point in time I&rsquo;ve got a kajillion Chrome tabs open, five or six Rails envs running (for dev and test) + Guard/Spork actively watching tests, and Sublime with another kajillion tabs open.</p>

<p>Turns out that OSX limits the number of open file descriptors per process to 256. Time to bump up the limit:</p>

<p>First, check out your current file limit:</p>

<p><code>$ launchctl limit</code></p>

<pre><code>    cpu         unlimited      unlimited      
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited      
    data        unlimited      unlimited      
    stack       8388608        67104768       
    core        0              unlimited      
    rss         unlimited      unlimited      
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited      
    maxproc     709            1064           
    maxfiles    256            unlimited
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s crank &lsquo;er up. First let&rsquo;s create <code>/etc/launchctl.conf</code></p>

<p><code>$ sudo touch /etc/launchctl.conf</code></p>

<p>And let&rsquo;s open it with your editor of choice. Add the following line to the new file:</p>

<p><code>limit maxfiles 16384 32768</code></p>

<p>Restart your computer. Boom. Easy.</p>

<p>One thing the Blurb devs have been discussing is how we can speed up our test feedback cycles without sacrificing coverage. There&rsquo;s some good tips (mainly Rails+Rspec/Cucumber) in the presentation such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t run all the tests when developing (tag your tests by function)</li>
<li>Parallelize, chunk tests over machines/cores using Testjour/<a href="https://github.com/sandro/specjour">Specjour</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ngauthier/hydra">Hydra</a></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t run all the tests at once. Tests that never fail should nightly.</li>
<li>Instead of spinning up a browser for acceptance tests, can you use a js/DOM simulator (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/thatcher/env-js">envjs</a> via <a href="https://github.com/smparkes/capybara-envjs">capybara-envjs</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/jarib/celerity">celerity</a>)</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, the inevitable happened: I finally experienced a hard drive failure. It&rsquo;s pretty incredible that in the twenty-odd years I&rsquo;ve been around computers I&rsquo;ve never had the horror of losing a drive.</p>

<p>Friday rolls around and my Macbook Pro decides to freeze up on me. <em>Strange, </em>I think to myself. It&rsquo;s making a clicking noise. Crap.</p>

<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;ve been fairly good about making backups and copies of my work. Here&rsquo;s my general strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Work/code: keeping local changes on a separate branch and pushing it to a remote Git branch every so often.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything else: I keep one local copy here with me in Oakland, and have another copy offsite. I rsync my files out to my server at home, which has a cronjob set up to sync with the offsite copy at my parents&#8217; home (I run a <a href="http://pogoplug.com/">Pogoplug</a> with <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/pogoplug-provideov3">Archlinux</a> and a couple of external drives connected to it &mdash; fantastic and totally recommended for a cheap and low-power server setup).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There was a minor scare this time around though &mdash; I had some photography work (and an engagement photoshoot!) lying around that almost didn&rsquo;t make it to the first stage rsync with my local server. Fortunately, I had the foresight to keep my photos backed up to a random local hard disk, and the rest remained on the memory cards (and some even on a shared Dropbox folder that saved my butt!). Most frustrating thing was learning that I had forgotten to back up my Lightroom catalog, so all my edits were lost. At least I have the original shots.</p>

<p>One thing I think I&rsquo;ll try doing from here on out &mdash; saving my Develop settings/presets directly to the DNGs themselves before backing up. That way if I ever lose my LR catalog, the edit settings are still embedded in the original files.</p>

<p>Jeff Atwood reminds us to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/01/whats-your-backup-strategy.html">keep backups around on multiple disks</a>. With the price of storage so low, what&rsquo;s your data worth to you? How are you keeping your backups?</p>
