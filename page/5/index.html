		<time>05 November 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Blurb sent me off to QCon SF 2014 for three days.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I took a series of notes each day in attendance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/2014-11-03-qconsf-day-one.html">Day One: Architectures, Functional</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/2014-11-04-qconsf-day-two.html">Day Two: Rx Systems, API Platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/2014-11-05-qconsf-day-three.html">Day Three: Microservices, Culture</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Big trends in continuous delivery and deployment &mdash; deploy more often, smaller feedback loops</li>
<li>A lot of emphasis on event driven architectures + microservices. Lots of emphasis on DDD as a design tool.</li>
<li>Reactive systems with functional implementations were widely discussed as a scaling tool (backpressure-sensitive) and as a coordination tool between multiple async services.</li>
<li>Big data/realtime streaming talks were interesting &mdash; my personal experience with them is limited, but it seems there is a debate over the merits of existing Lambda architecture practice.</li>
<li>A lot of talk about microservice orchestration tools &mdash; acknowledging the pain of configuration and management of many services.</li>
<li>Scala got a lotttt of attention. Probably because of its presence in bigger companies like Netflix, Twitter, LinkedIn. Wonder what smaller startups are using.</li>
<li>Web Components were a big upcoming trend in frontend technologies. Strong modularization of views + behaviors in HTML documents.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If I could do a startup over again, would I begin an app in Rails? Where is the sweet spot for that sort of application architecture?</li>
<li>How can I design systems such that they can be extractible into focused components/services as early as possible?</li>
<li>How can we plan for failures (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection">fault injection</a>)?</li>
<li>How does one implement change in software engineering organizations? Bottom-up (organic initiatives bubbling up through management) vs top-down (management/software leaders direct org to implement).</li>
<li>How are we doing with encouraging women and minorities who traditionally are underrepresented in our industry?</li>
<li>What are places in our hiring funnels that, unbeknownst to us, may be turning away or detracting women and minorities?</li>
</ul>

		<h1><a href="/2014/11/01/conways-law-for-humans/">Conway&#8217;s Law for humans</a></h1>
		<time>01 November 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a>, it states:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&rsquo;s communication structure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or in layman&rsquo;s terms, your software systems reflect the structure of the teams that create them.</p>

<p>Think about it &mdash; do your teams prefer to do everything themselves? Or do they ask for help from other teams? In general, as a team, we prefer to have as little dependencies as possible. The work that the engineer has to do to send an email, or wait for work from another team (like an API change or design change) is usually time-consuming and burdensome. Therefore, it is not (usually) in the team&rsquo;s best interests to cross silos and ask for help from others. Your teams, if they look like this, tend to work in codebases that are generally monolithic and wholly owned by the team.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong, or it&rsquo;s not bad, it&rsquo;s just a sociological observation. This is why companies like Spotify, Netflix or Amazon have embraced Conway&rsquo;s Law and changed their organizations to match the  microservice-driven architecture they want. Small teams work on small codebases and are empowered to make the changes they need.</p>

<h3>A corollary and some observations about your company culture.</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a corollary, which I&rsquo;ve heard in various shapes and forms. Paraphrased:</p>

<blockquote><p>An organization&rsquo;s structure tends to pattern after its leaders&#8217; communication patterns.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been pushing an effort to unify our company&rsquo;s frontend styles and UX into a unified framework in an attempt to standardize the look and feel of the site.</p>

<p>However, in working with our designers, I realized that they weren&rsquo;t talking to each other. Designers in one department had opposing design aesthetics from designers in another. This was causing problems in the code, because the frontend framework itself was becoming fragmented. You could see it in the code. Version A of the styleguide went into Department A&rsquo;s products. Version B of the styleguide went to Department B&rsquo;s products.</p>

<p>In this case, as we kept rolling out this framework, I realized our organization had no single owner for the design language of the site. Why? I had to wonder if it had to do with some deeper communication issues between the heads of the two departments.</p>

<p>Code can be a good canary to organizational issues, and call out larger human issues at hand. In this case, Conway&rsquo;s Law helps us root out and bring into the light structural concerns. Leaders can pay attention to these concerns and check themselves to become more open communicators.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2014/06/21/mocks-arent-stubs/">Mocks aren&#8217;t stubs: mockist & classic testing</a></h1>
		<time>21 June 2014</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>With the famed &ldquo;TDD is dead&rdquo; debate around the Rails community largely
coming to an end, I found myself referencing Martin Fowler&rsquo;s article,
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren&rsquo;t Stubs</a> a good deal, trying to make sense of it in terms of how I write tests and code.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to talk about mocking and stubbing and their
roots, paraphrase Fowler in an attempt to explain their differences, and
walk through a couple of code examples. In each case, I&rsquo;m going to
attempt to build this example out in Ruby and RSpec 3.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume this implementation in our code for a <code>BookUpdater</code> object in Ruby. Its job is to call through its collaborating <code>ApiClient</code>, which wraps some aspect of an API that we want to call.</p>

<h2>What they are</h2>

<h3>Mocks</h3>

<p>Mocks are fake objects that verify that they have received messages. In
RSpec, we traditionally use the <code>mock</code> object utility to create these objects.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">api_client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;api client&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">api_client</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:call_update_api</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">subject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">BookUpdater</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">api_client</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">subject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">list!</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What&rsquo;s happening here? RSpec creates a mock <code>api_client</code> object that will verify that, after the test case executes, it has received the <code>:call_update_api</code> message with the correct arguments.</p>

<p>The main point of this style of testing is <em>behavior verification</em> &mdash; that is, that your object is behaving correctly in relation with its collaborators.</p>

<h3>Double</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a <code>double</code> &mdash; also known as a <code>stub</code>. A <code>double</code> is a fake object that is set up to respond to a certain message with a pre-canned response, each time. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how I would set up a test using doubles:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">api_client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;api client&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">double</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;response&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:success?</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">allow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">api_client</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:call_update_api</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">with</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update!</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">change</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">subject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:updated?</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, so what&rsquo;s the big deal here? My test case still passes. Note that
I had to change my code to focus its expectation on the <code>subject</code>&rsquo;s
state instead of the <code>api_client</code>.</p>

<p>The focus of using doubles is for <em>state verification</em> &mdash; that is, that so long as everybody around me is behaving according to their contracts, the test merely has to verify that internal object state changes correctly.</p>

<h3>A third way &mdash; real objects</h3>

<p>I won&rsquo;t cover this very much in depth, but with sufficiently simple objects, one could actually instantiate real objects instead of doubles, and test an object against all its collaborators. This is, in my experience, the most common experience of working in Rails + ActiveRecord applications.</p>

<h2>Classic vs Mockist testing: different strokes for different folks</h2>

<p>As we saw above, the key difference between the mock and the stub (the <code>double</code>). The focus of the test in the mock case is on the messages being sent to the collaborators. The focus of the test when using the double is on the the <code>subject</code> under test (SUT).</p>

<p>Mocks and stubs/doubles are tools that we can use under the larger umbrellas of two TDD philosophical styles: <em>classic</em> vs <em>mockist</em> styles.</p>

<h3>Classic TDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Classic TDDists like using <code>double</code>s or real objects to test collaborators.</li>
<li>From personal experience, testing classicly is oftentimes the path of least resistance. There isn&rsquo;t expectation setup and verification that mockist testing requires of you.</li>
<li>Classic TDD sometimes results in creating objects that reveal state &mdash; note how the <code>BookUpdater</code> needed to expose an <code>updated?</code> method.</li>
<li>Setting up the state of the world prior to your test may be complex, requiring setting up all the objects in your universe. This can be a huge pain (has anybody ever had this problem with overcomplicated Rails models with spidery associations? Raise your hands&hellip;). Classicists may argue that the root cause here is not paying attention to your model architecture, and having too many associations is an antipattern. Alternatively, classicists oftentimes generate test factories (e.g. Rails&#8217; FactoryGirl gem) to manage test setup.</li>
<li>Tests tend to be treatable more like black boxes, testable under isolation (due to verifications on object state) and are more resistant to refactoring.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mockist TDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mockist TDD utilizes <code>mock</code>s to verify behavior between objects and collaborators.</li>
<li>It can be argued to develop &ldquo;purer&rdquo; objects, that are mainly concerned with objects passing messages to each other. Fowler refers to these objects as preferring role-interfaces.</li>
<li>These tests are easier to set up, as they don&rsquo;t require setting up the state of the world prior to test invocation.</li>
<li>Tests tend to be more coupled to implementation, and may be more difficult to refactor due to very specific requirements for message passing between collaborators.</li>
<li>Fowler brings up a point where being a mockist means that your objects prefer to <a href="https://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask">Tell Don&rsquo;t Ask</a>. A nice side effect of TDA is you generally can avoid Demeter violations.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In conclusion</h2>

<p>In coming from a classic TDD background, I&rsquo;ve oftentimes viewed mockist testing with some suspicion, particularly around how much work is involved to bring them about. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve warmed up to the usage of mockist testing, but have not been diligent enough at doing pure driving TDD with mocks. In reviewing Fowler&rsquo;s comments, I&rsquo;m intruiged at the possibilities of mockist TDD in affecting system design, particularly in their natural inclinations toward <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RoleInterface.html">role interfaces</a>. I look forward to trying pure mockist TDD in a future project.</p>
