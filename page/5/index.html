  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had my first taste of Marmite last year while in Botswana. My South African roommate loved it, and encouraged me to try it and spread it on my toast. One bite and I gagged. It was like somebody mixed soy sauce and peanut butter and cranked it to 11.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Reposted from the <a href="http://blog.wejoinin.com/2010/03/14/server-transition-nuts-and-bolts/">Wejoinin Blog</a>)</p>

<p>When you run a Web app like Wejoinin on minimal VPS resources (read: we&rsquo;re too poor to get a beefy server), it forces you to go lean. We started to realize a year ago that our out-of-the-box Rails and nginx/Mongrel setup was starting to show its age; resource utilization would climb every so often and we&rsquo;d have to kill and restart a Mongrel thread.</p>

<p>Well, with last night&rsquo;s Wejoinin push, we&rsquo;ve upgraded our server environment a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve switched to <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr.com with a killer deal</a> on a 512MiB VPS. This is a step up from the 256 slice we used to hold at <a href="www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> at almost half the price.</p></li>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve switched from vanilla Ruby to <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition </a>&mdash; advertised to take &ldquo;33% less memory [when used with Passenger]&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s got a tweaked garbage collector, memory allocator and the ability to go in a tweak memory usage settings for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve set up <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>, the new HTTP server on the block. It&rsquo;s special in that each worker is in its own process, meaning that the load balancing is done natively by the OS. Also, this means that should a worker process start to get bloated, we can take it down gracefully without touching the others. Really. <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix">We can trust the OS</a>. Plus, <a href="http://github.com/blog/517-unicorn">Git&rsquo;s doing it</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With all these tweaks, we should be seeing Wejoinin rarin&#8217; to go. Let us know what you think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/2010/03/12/shiny-font-overhaul/screenshot1/"><img src="http://www.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/screenshot1-500x126.png" alt="" /></a></h3>

<p>A couple of months ago I switched over to TypeKit, a cloud-hosted font service (buzzword! &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; gets me all warm and fuzzy). They basically take your font stack and enhance it with @font-face goodness, pulling in lots of fonts from their library.</p>

<h3>Why not roll a @font-face implementation yourself?</h3>

<p>The availability of good, high-quality, <em>licensed</em> fonts out there is still pretty small. The hoopla over @font-face has been centered around the fact that the fonts are unobfuscated, and anybody with the gumption to do so could go out to your site and steal yer font. So I&rsquo;d say if you have a font you want to put up on the Web, you&rsquo;d better make sure the font publisher/licenseholder is kosher with that.</p>

<p>(Ironically, Microsoft got it pretty right with their EOT font format, drafted way back in the days of IE 4 (!). Oh yeah, TypeKit takes care of EOT fonts for you as well.)</p>

<p>(Also, Mozilla is pushing their <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/10/woff/">WOFF format</a> which is currently supported in FF 3.6. Typekit does that too!).</p>

<h3>So, how&rsquo;s TypeKit working out for you?</h3>

<p>Well, TypeKit&rsquo;s not bad. If you&rsquo;re running a cutting-edge browser (Safari 4, FF 3+, Chromium 4), you&rsquo;re going to see the font shininess. If you&rsquo;re not, you still get the default stack.</p>

<p>A problem way early on was the fact that Firefox for Windows was rendering certain fonts with very, very jagged features (<a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/typekit-first-impressions/">see comparisons</a>). Turns out this was a fault of both the font and the OS/browser&mdash; certain browsers and OSes don&rsquo;t render hints properly.</p>

<p>The best solution I&rsquo;ve found? <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/12/08/new-fonts-and-improved-hinting-from-our-partners/">Use a better font with better hinting</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using FF Nuvo Web and FF Enzo Web Pro:</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m currently in Botswana, doing volunteer work at a nonprofit Christian agency called <a href="http://lovebotswana.org">Love Botswana Outreach Mission</a>. Among my responsibilities are helping out with the organization&rsquo;s IT needs. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the organization is wired for 24/7 Internet access, despite being located about 10km out from the center of Maun, a medium-sized village.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>As far as I understand it, there is little-to-no telecom infrastructure here in Maun (i.e. there are no telephone, cable or fiber lines). Thus, most communication links happen via satellite or wifi radio.</p>

<p>The mission has a 100-ft radio tower, where a local ISP colocates a wireless repeater to hook into its wireless network. In exchange, the mission receives a special deal on its Internet access plan.</p>

<h3>Existing network setup</h3>

<p>Because of the relatively low price and quick setup of wireless access points, the mission currently uses a mix of wired switches and wireless repeaters to extend the reach of the network.</p>

<p>A directional antenna on the tower beams a signal to a directional antenna mounted above the IT office trailer to an access point connected through a gateway serving as the DHCP server and firewall. From there, the signal gets sent via a a wired Ethernet network to the other office buildings.</p>

<p>Wireless access points have been installed at various points along the wired office network, allowing wireless access onto the Net.</p>

<p>Only recently has Internet connectivity been extended to reach a cluster of family homes, situated about 200 meters away from the office buildings. A wireless access point is set up in the IT trailer, broadcasting on a +10dB omnidirectional antenna. The closest house to the office has an outdoor +10dB omnidirectional antenna hooked up to a wireless bridge/repeater. Thus, the link from the houses to the gateway is maintained via a wireless bridge. The houses themselves are connected on a hardwired Ethernet network.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the field</h3>

<h4>Lesson: plan for environmental factors.</h4>

<p>We observed that the wireless link from the homes to the offices would be intermittently reliable at best, often going down for no reason. We discovered later on that our link would fail on particularly humid days, because the signal quality over the wireless bridge would degrade significantly and decrease the range of the network.</p>

<h4>Lesson: keep power voltages in mind.</h4>

<p>I fried a power supply when I left it switched to a 115V (US) input, and plugged it into the 220V power plugs there. Sizzle. This led to a lot of apologizing and reassurances from the staff that this was a common thing for Americans to do.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Clean computers frequently.</h4>

<p>Dust is a common fact of life here. Thus, computer innards were frequently coated with dust, and more susceptible to overheating and/or a shorter lifecycle on moving parts (fans, etc).</p>

<h4>Lesson: Scan for viruses, too</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but viruses just seem to be more common here. I&rsquo;ve been passed a few flash drives that have been infected. In the states, I&rsquo;d be (un)lucky to find one a year.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Plan for low bandwidth and outages</h4>

<p>In the States, we depend on always-on Internet. Here, however, the Internet seems to go down for any of a multitude of reasons. If it <em>is</em> up, it&rsquo;s being shared by fifteen computers all downloading at once over an already-restricted pipeline. Thus, Web pages can&rsquo;t be expected to load reliably, Skype sessions will cut out, and chat services won&rsquo;t be accessible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to depend on <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-in-labs-offline-gmail.html">Offline Gmail</a> to compose email when the Internet&rsquo;s down. Other productivity apps like <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> offer offline modes for their applications.</p>

<p>I rely on Bonjour-enabled chat (iChat on a Mac, <a href="http://pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> + <a href="http://apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.htm">Bonjour for Windows</a>) for the times when the Internet or DHCP server goes down and I need to chat with somebody in another office or house.</p>

<p>When making large-ish downloads, I&rsquo;ve gone to using a download manager (flashback to the days of the 56K modem trying to download a 20 MB file)! I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://freedownloadmanager.org">Free Download Manager</a>. It&rsquo;s not much of a name, but it&rsquo;s a full-featured open source program allowing you to schedule, pause, resume downloads.</p>

<p>Just FYI: my downloads range between 900 bytes/sec up to 28KB/sec.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Designing Web pages for low bandwidth is still a good idea</h4>

<p>As a Web developer, I tend to make the erroneous assumption people have the same quality of high-speed connection as I do back home in the States. Now that I&rsquo;m a continent away from most of the sites I visit, I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that optimizing a site for bandwidth savings can be a lifesaver. Here, a round trip to and from the States can take up to 20 seconds. That adds up over the course of a page load. As a Web designer or developer, ask yourself if you can be doing anything for the &ldquo;56K guy&rdquo;: Are you using CSS sprites? A CDN? Compressing (gzip, mod_deflate) your output? Are you optimizing your image files for the Web?</p>

<h4>Lesson: Knock out as many failure points as possible</h4>

<p>Because the wireless bridge seemed to be the weakest link in our network, we decided to bypass it. We ran a really long Ethernet line from the IT office to the houses. This meant ordering a 200-meter length of cable, some sleeving and doing a lot of trench-digging to embed the cable under the dirt access roads. Our work paid off as everybody in the houses now enjoys a reliable network link to the main server (including me!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to connect my laptop to the wireless AP in my apartment. Additionally, I&rsquo;d be getting weak signals from all these weird corners in my apartment. Since I had a spare AP lying around at home, I decided to do some online research to see if I could get it to behave as a second wireless AP on the same network, extending my network range, allowing our network to handle more wireless users and playing nicely with my laptop.</p>

<h4>The desired setup:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Two wireless routers on the same network: one router acts as the gateway and DHCP server, the other is a simple switch + wireless AP. One router is the Netgear WGR614, the other is the DLink DI-624.</p></li>
<li><p>Workload: many wired connections, many wireless connections. We have 3 wired computers for me and my roommates&#8217; computers, and up to 10 people connected via wireless at the same time (we tend to have a lot of visitors).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After a bit of research, I <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,10664212">found a forum thread online</a> that details how to set it up:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The host router (the Netgear in my case) stays the DHCP server and broadband gateway. Settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assign a static IP on the MAC address of the secondary router. It&rsquo;s 192.168.1.3 on my network. That way you&rsquo;ll always have an IP address to the second router&rsquo;s admin panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Run an Ethernet cable from the host router&rsquo;s LAN port in to the LAN port of the second router (the DLink). (Note: it&rsquo;s especially important that you plug this wire in to the LAN port instead of the WAN port).</p></li>
<li><p>With a computer connected on the network, send your browser on over to the D-Link admin panel at 192.168.1.3. Your settings on the DI-624 should be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;WAN Settings&rdquo; section (Note the 20.2.20.x IP is just a random IP address so the AP doesn&rsquo;t go off and try to dynamically resolve a IP address)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Static IP Address&rdquo; radio button selected</p></li>
<li><p>IP Address: 20.2.20.20</p></li>
<li><p>Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0</p></li>
<li><p>ISP Gateway Address: 20.2.20.21</p></li>
<li><p>Primary DNS address: 20.2.20.22</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;LAN Settings&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Static IP: 192.168.1.3</p></li>
<li><p>Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0</p></li>
<li><p>DNS Relay: Disabled.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;DHCP Settings&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHCP Server: Disabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Wireless&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up your wireless AP settings however you&rsquo;d like!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Though these instructions are specific to setting up the DI-624, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you could get your old router to work on an existing network.You can now extend the range of your home&rsquo;s wireless network without any fancy signal booster tricks or expensive repeater equipment. How cool is that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One trend on the Web these days is to move away from traditional full-stack frameworks (like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>) toward client-side, full-stack Javascript frameworks (among them <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, <a href="http://sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a>, and <a href="http://cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a>). There&rsquo;s been a lot of buzz about <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a> and <a href="http://www.cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a>, because of their design elegance, shiny Mac-ness and promises of really rich client experiences. I&rsquo;ve been checking them out and here&rsquo;s some of my observations so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They&rsquo;re both really young: SproutCore and Cappuccino have emerged only in the last three months. I haven&rsquo;t heard of any deployed Cappuccino apps asides from the storied <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides app</a>. Same with SproutCore, looks like asides from <a href="http://www.me.com">MobileMe</a>, they&rsquo;re only beginning to see user-created apps come out (see: <a href="http://blog.otherinbox.com/">OtherInbox</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The two frameworks are beautiful. Because they both model on Cocoa, they both take on the same icon set, window chrome, pane behaviors, and so on. Nice work, lifting the good UI work from the Mac and placing it on the Web.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-J sounds cool. I just can&rsquo;t see non-Cocoa programmers just picking it up, though. Even though I picked up Cocoa over the summer and I think it&rsquo;s pretty awesome, there was no way I would have the energy to pick up Objective-J on my own (unless Cappuccino proves itself to be THAT big of a draw).</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, but to be fair, the idea of &ldquo;Cocoa on the Web&rdquo; is phenomenal. I wonder if we&rsquo;ll see a surge of ported Cocoa-to-Web apps. Aligning Cappuccino with AppKit is a great idea, and it&rsquo;s clearly the &ldquo;Web framework for Cocoa apps moving to the Web&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re gonna want to use it for sure if you&rsquo;re a proven Cocoa hacker. I wonder, however, if it can capture users who aren&rsquo;t Cocoa programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m a big sucker for looks. Nothing gets me excited like SproutCore applications do in all their Aqua-like goodness. GWT in comparison looks pretty frumpy. I really like OS X-looking widgets. What can I say, I was brainwashed :)</p></li>
<li><p>SproutCore and Cappuccino apps are simply not going to be able to out-perform GWT apps: they simply can&rsquo;t beat the compiler optimizations of compiled and optimized JS in GWT. Then again&hellip; we&rsquo;re going to have crazy fast JS engines in the next year or so. We&rsquo;ll see if performance is an issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Even though these two frameworks are only beginning to gather momentum, I&rsquo;m excited at the direction they&rsquo;re moving the Web in. Anybody else want to weigh in?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m looking to develop a Web application with a full-stack Javascript framework like <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>, <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a> or <a href="http://www.cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a>. I&rsquo;m making the decision to go with a Javascript framework over a traditional full-stack framework (like Rails) because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I get richer, desktop-like functionality in the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>I can offload much of the work from the server onto the client.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s less Javascript hand-coding so I don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>I can bring the desktop app programming paradigm straight to the client.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> (Google Web Toolkit), <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a> and <a href="http://www.cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a>, and here&rsquo;s some of my observations so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>GWT is the most mature framework out of the three at 2 years. SproutCore and Cappuccino have emerged only in the last three months.</p></li>
<li><p>SproutCore is really, really, beautiful. Just look at MobileMe. I&rsquo;m sure Cappuccino looks much the same. It&rsquo;s probably because both emulate Cocoa, and so take on the same icon set, window chrome, pane behaviors, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-J sounds cool. I picked up Cocoa over the summer, and to have it on a Web browser is going to be phenomenal.</p></li>
<li><p>Cappuccino is so new that there aren&rsquo;t that many apps out there (asides from the storied <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides app</a>). I&rsquo;m worried that it could be buggy and docs are too sparse.</p></li>
<li><p>Something about Java in GWT makes me cringe. Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m not used to that extra compilation step. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been mucking in dynamic languages for too long of a time.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m a big sucker for looks. GWT looks pretty frumpy. Honestly, it doesn&rsquo;t get me excited like SproutCore applications do in all their Aqua-like goodness.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ext widgets from <a href="http://extjs.com/products/gxt/">Ext-GWT</a> are only slightly better. I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t complain&hellip; but gosh, I really like OS X-looking widgets. What can I say, I was brainwashed :)</p></li>
<li><p>SproutCore and Cappuccino are slower: they simply can&rsquo;t beat the compiler optimizations of compiled and optimized JS in GWT. Then again&hellip; we&rsquo;re going to have crazy fast JS engines in the next year or so.</p></li>
<li><p>I considered <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>. Sort of. I like it because it&rsquo;s more mature than SC, but it&rsquo;s slower than GWT and doesn&rsquo;t have as many widgets as Ext.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Honestly, even though my &ldquo;ooh-shiny&rdquo; sense wants to use SproutCore, my objective reasoning tells me to go for GWT for its stronger support, more maturity, better performance and a fuller set of widgets. Anybody else want to weigh in?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&rsquo;m in the process of doing some housekeeping around the blog, I&rsquo;ve begun moving my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/sets/72157602687541585/">old design portfolio over to Flickr</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/sets/72157602687541585/"><img src="http://www.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/design-gallery-updated-300x288.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This is sort of an intermediary step to another intermediary step of overhauling my portfolio (yeah, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for the past five years). Watch this space for updated project briefs to come trickling in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Spring 2008, I took an information architecture course in the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>, taught by <a href="http://dret.typepad.com">Erik Wilde</a> (disclaimer: I dropped the course after a month because of schedule conflicts). An interesting part of my research for that class involved investigating the nascent <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE)</a> protocol, a way of organizing groups of resources across the Web. I&rsquo;m going to try to describe in laymen&rsquo;s terms what I learned from my research and explain why it&rsquo;s significant.</p>

<h3>Group things together on the Web</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for a book online. You&rsquo;ll hit up JStor or Google Books and browse through the pages of that book you found. Easy enough, right?</p>

<p>In reality, the <em>physical, electronic representation</em> of the book online is actually more than just &ldquo;that book on JStor&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jstor.com/book">http://www.jstor.com/book</a>&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s actually a collection of images on a Web server. We need a uniform way to descibe that jStor&#8217; specific online version of &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; is actually comprised of &ldquo;page1.jpg&rdquo;, &ldquo;page2.jpg&rdquo;, et cetera.</p>

<p>As another example, let&rsquo;s say that the local public library wants to create a digital representation of its materials on Jimi Hendrix. Well, the library&rsquo;s got Jimi Hendrix CDs, Jimi Hendrix books, Jimi Hendrix magazine articles, and so on. With the OAI-ORE protocol, we can create a digital &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix @ Your Local Public Library&rdquo; object that lists out each CD, book and magazine article contained in the library.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say on top of that, a certain Jimi Hendrix biography references &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; on pages 12, 141 and 254. This &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; object is capable of encoding that reference from those pages to &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Axis: Bold as Love&rdquo; album in the library.</p>

<h3>Why even have a description framework?</h3>

<p>As the Web gets more connected and as we&rsquo;re seeing the rise of interoperable Web services, it becomes increasingly important to have a standard resource description language. Various protocols (such as RDF) have built a foundation on which to describe relationships between electronic resources.</p>

<p>Think of OAI-ORE as a way of organizing information for re-use by others. If every library created its own &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; resource object and made them accessible to others, we could potentially create programs and Web services to collect all &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; objects from across the globe and reconstruct the ultimate, canonical Jimi Hendrix electronic resource library. We could note which books made references to &ldquo;Little Wing.&rdquo; We could view &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; as an WMA file, an MP3 file, or as lyrics.</p>

<p>The key is that by standardizing a description language, we <strong>enable programmatic ways to collect and synthesize data</strong> that can potentially add to the value of the world&rsquo;s sum knowledge.</p>

<h3>Resource maps &amp; implementation formats</h3>

<p>OAI-ORE is a specification that defines relationships between resources through an object called the <em>resource map</em>. The resource map is a resource file enumerating a collection of resources and describing the relationships between each resource. Each resource map has its own URI, so it can be discoverable and accessible.</p>

<p>There is no standard file format to encode resource maps. Currently, the OAI-ORE working group has suggested the following description formats (HT: <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/downloads/IT19-Hunter-OAI-ORE-Oct30.ppt">Univ. of Queensland</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF</a> (Resource Description Framework)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard">Atom</a>) syndication format</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://nurture.nature.com/yads">YADS</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/">TriX</a> (RDF triples in XML)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/rdfxml">recommended method of describing a resource map is in RDF/XML</a>. I&rsquo;m not very familiar with the RDF syntax, however, and the TriX format, which affords us RDF triples that can easiliy express relationships between objects and resources, seems to make more sense to me.. However, there is a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.1/atom">complete Atom implementation of the protocol</a>, used when syndication is preferred.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d definitely refer the reader to the <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/downloads/IT19-Hunter-OAI-ORE-Oct30.ppt">Univ. of Queensland&rsquo;s OAI-ORE PDF overview</a> for a broader overview of the protocol and its potential implementations.</p>

<h3>The nitty-gritty</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>Collections</strong>: Multiple resources can be grouped together, but only via an &ldquo;aggregate object&rdquo; or a &ldquo;collection&rdquo;, which maintains pointers to each object in a collection.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong>: Links describe relationships between objects in a resource map, such as &ldquo;has-part&rdquo; (&ldquo;War &amp; Peace &rdquo;-has-part-&ldquo;page 2&rdquo;) or &ldquo;derived-from&rdquo; (&ldquo;Radiohead &ndash; 15 Step Remix&rdquo;-derived-from-&ldquo;Radiohead &ndash; 15 Step&rdquo;). Actual relationships depend on selected vocabularies and namespaces (meaning you can change the link relationships to be whatever you need them to be). There is a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/primer.html#Namespaces">list of default namespaces on the spec</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>I took a high-level and somewhat abstract tack in describing the protocol, and would direct you to the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/primer.html">OAI-ORE Primer</a> for more implementation specifics. Apologies to those of you who were completely lost in this discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited about developing standards like these because resource mapping protocols such as OAI-ORE are an instrumental step in connecting resources, services and information on the Web. They&rsquo;ll help us &ldquo;connect the tubes&rdquo; and create the infrastructure needed to link the world&rsquo;s information together. Now that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
