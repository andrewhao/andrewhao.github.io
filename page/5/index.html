  <div class="entry-content"><p>A month ago I bought an &lsquo;07 MacBook on Craigslist. No, it&rsquo;s not one of those sexy aluminum hot rods, but it sure is pretty.</p>

<p>I was full of mixed emotions. I had finally joined the Tribe! I had sold my soul. I can now develop iPhone apps! I am property of SJ. Yes, I had interned at Apple in the summer of &lsquo;08, but I haven&rsquo;t really paid much attention to OS X until I&rsquo;ve owned one of these suckers for myself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy making the switch. Here are some of my gripes with OSX and some stopgap replacements I&rsquo;ve found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No keyboard shortcut to maximize windows. (Solved with <a href="http://www.blazingtools.com/downloads.html#RightZoom">RightZoom</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>MacPorts really sucks (that is, having to compile everything from source is really slow). (Still outstanding)</p></li>
<li><p>Switching windows between spaces is really clunky. (Sorta solved with <a href="http://thecocoabots.com/hyperspaces/">Hyperspaces</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>No keyboard shortcut to &ldquo;move active window to space&rdquo;. (Still outstanding)</p></li>
<li><p>No way to force windows to a grid. (Solved with <a href="http://www.mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>No right Ctrl key makes things really painful in Emacs. (Remapped right &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; with <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Aero Snap is cool. (Check out <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/">Cinch</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The MacBook keyboard keys feel cheap compared to a Thinkpad. (Still outstanding)</p></li>
<li><p>Really annoyed with Command-Tab switching. I just want to switch to a different window! (Still outstanding).</p></li>
<li><p>Expose feels limited compared to Compiz&#8217; Scale plugin. Cannot Expose all windows in all spaces. (Still outstanding)</p></li>
<li><p>Closing window doesn&rsquo;t kill the process. I suspect this is just a design philosophy I have to deal with. (Still outstanding)</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure why, but my wrists generally tend to hurt more after using the MB rather than my work Thinkpad.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not going to do all complaining. Some things I really enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Drag-and-drop installation is totally elegant.</p></li>
<li><p>Time Machine just works, and the zoomable interface is totally slick.</p></li>
<li><p>Helvetica Neue, I love you.</p></li>
<li><p>Something about the font rendering is just amazing.</p></li>
<li><p>I get to look cool (and slightly cliche&hellip;) at coffee shops</p></li>
<li><p>Desktop graphics &amp; animations render smoothly with CoreAnimation. This stuff just looks slick.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not as bad as I&rsquo;ve made it out to be. Well here I am. Swore I&rsquo;d never do it, but you got me with all that shiny, Mr. Jobs. You got me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s how to set up the excellent VMware-developed open-source <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a> and its <code>[post-review](http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/dev/rbtools/0.2/)</code> command line review creation utility to work with git and git-svn on your computer.</p>

<p>My assumption is that you&rsquo;re working with a local Git repository that is remotely linked to an SVN repository via the <a href="http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/git-svn/intro.html">git-svn</a> bridge. Let&rsquo;s assume that your master branch is synced with the SVN repository, and you&rsquo;re working on <code>bug_12345_branch</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Make sure you have RBTools installed (<code>sudo easy_install rbtools</code> for me on Ubuntu Linux), and Review Board set up elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p> Add a link to your Review Board URL in .git/config:</p></li>
</ol>


<blockquote><pre><code>[reviewboard]
 url = &lt;a href="#"&gt;https://(url_for_review_board)/&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p> Make sure all your changes in <code>bug_12345_branch</code> have been locally committed.</p></li>
<li><p> <code>post-review -o</code>, and&hellip;</p></li>
<li><p> Voila! You should have a new review up on your Review Board instance.</p></li>
<li><p> (After you get reviews, you can modify <code>bug_12345_branch</code>, pull the changes into master, and then <code>git svn dcommit</code>, blah, blah, blah.)</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work, we make good use of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI 3</a>. It&rsquo;s a really well-thought-out framework, from sandboxing and deep namespaces to CSS3 selector support and lazy-loading modules through the Yahoo! CDN. One of YUI 3&rsquo;s biggest features is the Widget framework, which specifies an object on the page that the user can tweak to his or her whims.</p>

<p>Now typically, a YUI widget must be instantiated, then rendered onto the page. The render method is responsible for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Writing the widget&rsquo;s DOM elements out to the page</p></li>
<li><p> Binding handlers onto the DOM object.</p></li>
<li><p> Updating the widget state to match the JS object state.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>(This information didn&rsquo;t come easily. I had to dig around in some YUI slides and found this in <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=desai-yuiconf2009-widgets">Satyen Desai&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Widget Walkthrough&rdquo; presentation</a> at YUIConf 2009.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/2010/04/27/yui-widget-lazy-instantiation/screenshot5/"><img src="http://www.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/screenshot5-499x374.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Now we have a page that generates hundreds if not thousands of these tooltips. Instantiating each tooltip, rendering them into the DOM and generating event handlers for each was wasteful and slowed IE browsers down to a crawl. So this brought us to the decision to lazily instantiate each Tooltip instance. My first thought was that I should be able to overwrite the render() method to write to the DOM only after a mouseover onto the Tooltip trigger.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the folly: note that in the previous slide, the event handlers don&rsquo;t go live until after the widget HTML is rendered into the DOM. Rats. Is there any way I can get around this?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some peculiar code for the Tooltip wrapper:</p>

<pre><code>function ttWrapper(triggerNode) {
  this.tt = null;
  /* First mouseover will instantiate the real TooltipWidget. */
  var mOver = Y.on('mouseover', function (e) {
    this.tt = new TooltipWidget(/*config*/).render();
    /* Detach this listener so it won't intercept any more mouseovers */
    mOver.detach();
    /* A second mouseover must be simulated on the real TooltipWidget */
    Y.Event.simulate(triggerNode, 'mouseover'); 
  }, triggerNode);




}
</code></pre>

<p>The code installs a mouseover listener on the trigger node, then swaps itself out for the real mouseover listener that gets attached to the triggerNode when TooltipWidget gets instantiated. Event.simulate() is a strange, yet smart way to solve this problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Reposted from the <a href="http://blog.wejoinin.com/2010/03/14/server-transition-nuts-and-bolts/">Wejoinin Blog</a>)</p>

<p>When you run a Web app like Wejoinin on minimal VPS resources (read: we&rsquo;re too poor to get a beefy server), it forces you to go lean. We started to realize a year ago that our out-of-the-box Rails and nginx/Mongrel setup was starting to show its age; resource utilization would climb every so often and we&rsquo;d have to kill and restart a Mongrel thread.</p>

<p>Well, with last night&rsquo;s Wejoinin push, we&rsquo;ve upgraded our server environment a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve switched to <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr.com with a killer deal</a> on a 512MiB VPS. This is a step up from the 256 slice we used to hold at <a href="www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> at almost half the price.</p></li>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve switched from vanilla Ruby to <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition </a>&mdash; advertised to take &ldquo;33% less memory [when used with Passenger]&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s got a tweaked garbage collector, memory allocator and the ability to go in a tweak memory usage settings for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p> We&rsquo;ve set up <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>, the new HTTP server on the block. It&rsquo;s special in that each worker is in its own process, meaning that the load balancing is done natively by the OS. Also, this means that should a worker process start to get bloated, we can take it down gracefully without touching the others. Really. <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/unicorn-is-unix">We can trust the OS</a>. Plus, <a href="http://github.com/blog/517-unicorn">Git&rsquo;s doing it</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With all these tweaks, we should be seeing Wejoinin rarin&#8217; to go. Let us know what you think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/2010/03/12/shiny-font-overhaul/screenshot1/"><img src="http://www.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/screenshot1-500x126.png" alt="" /></a></h3>

<p>A couple of months ago I switched over to TypeKit, a cloud-hosted font service (buzzword! &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; gets me all warm and fuzzy). They basically take your font stack and enhance it with @font-face goodness, pulling in lots of fonts from their library.</p>

<h3>Why not roll a @font-face implementation yourself?</h3>

<p>The availability of good, high-quality, <em>licensed</em> fonts out there is still pretty small. The hoopla over @font-face has been centered around the fact that the fonts are unobfuscated, and anybody with the gumption to do so could go out to your site and steal yer font. So I&rsquo;d say if you have a font you want to put up on the Web, you&rsquo;d better make sure the font publisher/licenseholder is kosher with that.</p>

<p>(Ironically, Microsoft got it pretty right with their EOT font format, drafted way back in the days of IE 4 (!). Oh yeah, TypeKit takes care of EOT fonts for you as well.)</p>

<p>(Also, Mozilla is pushing their <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/10/woff/">WOFF format</a> which is currently supported in FF 3.6. Typekit does that too!).</p>

<h3>So, how&rsquo;s TypeKit working out for you?</h3>

<p>Well, TypeKit&rsquo;s not bad. If you&rsquo;re running a cutting-edge browser (Safari 4, FF 3+, Chromium 4), you&rsquo;re going to see the font shininess. If you&rsquo;re not, you still get the default stack.</p>

<p>A problem way early on was the fact that Firefox for Windows was rendering certain fonts with very, very jagged features (<a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/typekit-first-impressions/">see comparisons</a>). Turns out this was a fault of both the font and the OS/browser&mdash; certain browsers and OSes don&rsquo;t render hints properly.</p>

<p>The best solution I&rsquo;ve found? <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2009/12/08/new-fonts-and-improved-hinting-from-our-partners/">Use a better font with better hinting</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using FF Nuvo Web and FF Enzo Web Pro:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.g9labs.com/2010/03/12/shiny-font-overhaul/screenshot-g9labs-design-studio-typekit-namoroka/"><img src="http://www.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Screenshot-g9Labs-Design-Studio-Typekit-Namoroka-500x412.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m currently in Botswana, doing volunteer work at a nonprofit Christian agency called <a href="http://lovebotswana.org">Love Botswana Outreach Mission</a>. Among my responsibilities are helping out with the organization&rsquo;s IT needs. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the organization is wired for 24/7 Internet access, despite being located about 10km out from the center of Maun, a medium-sized village.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>As far as I understand it, there is little-to-no telecom infrastructure here in Maun (i.e. there are no telephone, cable or fiber lines). Thus, most communication links happen via satellite or wifi radio.</p>

<p>The mission has a 100-ft radio tower, where a local ISP colocates a wireless repeater to hook into its wireless network. In exchange, the mission receives a special deal on its Internet access plan.</p>

<h3>Existing network setup</h3>

<p>Because of the relatively low price and quick setup of wireless access points, the mission currently uses a mix of wired switches and wireless repeaters to extend the reach of the network.</p>

<p>A directional antenna on the tower beams a signal to a directional antenna mounted above the IT office trailer to an access point connected through a gateway serving as the DHCP server and firewall. From there, the signal gets sent via a a wired Ethernet network to the other office buildings.</p>

<p>Wireless access points have been installed at various points along the wired office network, allowing wireless access onto the Net.</p>

<p>Only recently has Internet connectivity been extended to reach a cluster of family homes, situated about 200 meters away from the office buildings. A wireless access point is set up in the IT trailer, broadcasting on a +10dB omnidirectional antenna. The closest house to the office has an outdoor +10dB omnidirectional antenna hooked up to a wireless bridge/repeater. Thus, the link from the houses to the gateway is maintained via a wireless bridge. The houses themselves are connected on a hardwired Ethernet network.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the field</h3>

<h4>Lesson: plan for environmental factors.</h4>

<p>We observed that the wireless link from the homes to the offices would be intermittently reliable at best, often going down for no reason. We discovered later on that our link would fail on particularly humid days, because the signal quality over the wireless bridge would degrade significantly and decrease the range of the network.</p>

<h4>Lesson: keep power voltages in mind.</h4>

<p>I fried a power supply when I left it switched to a 115V (US) input, and plugged it into the 220V power plugs there. Sizzle. This led to a lot of apologizing and reassurances from the staff that this was a common thing for Americans to do.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Clean computers frequently.</h4>

<p>Dust is a common fact of life here. Thus, computer innards were frequently coated with dust, and more susceptible to overheating and/or a shorter lifecycle on moving parts (fans, etc).</p>

<h4>Lesson: Scan for viruses, too</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but viruses just seem to be more common here. I&rsquo;ve been passed a few flash drives that have been infected. In the states, I&rsquo;d be (un)lucky to find one a year.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Plan for low bandwidth and outages</h4>

<p>In the States, we depend on always-on Internet. Here, however, the Internet seems to go down for any of a multitude of reasons. If it <em>is</em> up, it&rsquo;s being shared by fifteen computers all downloading at once over an already-restricted pipeline. Thus, Web pages can&rsquo;t be expected to load reliably, Skype sessions will cut out, and chat services won&rsquo;t be accessible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come to depend on <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-in-labs-offline-gmail.html">Offline Gmail</a> to compose email when the Internet&rsquo;s down. Other productivity apps like <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> offer offline modes for their applications.</p>

<p>I rely on Bonjour-enabled chat (iChat on a Mac, <a href="http://pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> + <a href="http://apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.htm">Bonjour for Windows</a>) for the times when the Internet or DHCP server goes down and I need to chat with somebody in another office or house.</p>

<p>When making large-ish downloads, I&rsquo;ve gone to using a download manager (flashback to the days of the 56K modem trying to download a 20 MB file)! I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://freedownloadmanager.org">Free Download Manager</a>. It&rsquo;s not much of a name, but it&rsquo;s a full-featured open source program allowing you to schedule, pause, resume downloads.</p>

<p>Just FYI: my downloads range between 900 bytes/sec up to 28KB/sec.</p>

<h4>Lesson: Designing Web pages for low bandwidth is still a good idea</h4>

<p>As a Web developer, I tend to make the erroneous assumption people have the same quality of high-speed connection as I do back home in the States. Now that I&rsquo;m a continent away from most of the sites I visit, I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that optimizing a site for bandwidth savings can be a lifesaver. Here, a round trip to and from the States can take up to 20 seconds. That adds up over the course of a page load. As a Web designer or developer, ask yourself if you can be doing anything for the &ldquo;56K guy&rdquo;: Are you using CSS sprites? A CDN? Compressing (gzip, mod_deflate) your output? Are you optimizing your image files for the Web?</p>

<h4>Lesson: Knock out as many failure points as possible</h4>

<p>Because the wireless bridge seemed to be the weakest link in our network, we decided to bypass it. We ran a really long Ethernet line from the IT office to the houses. This meant ordering a 200-meter length of cable, some sleeving and doing a lot of trench-digging to embed the cable under the dirt access roads. Our work paid off as everybody in the houses now enjoys a reliable network link to the main server (including me!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to connect my laptop to the wireless AP in my apartment. Additionally, I&rsquo;d be getting weak signals from all these weird corners in my apartment. Since I had a spare AP lying around at home, I decided to do some online research to see if I could get it to behave as a second wireless AP on the same network, extending my network range, allowing our network to handle more wireless users and playing nicely with my laptop.</p>

<h4>The desired setup:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Two wireless routers on the same network: one router acts as the gateway and DHCP server, the other is a simple switch + wireless AP. One router is the Netgear WGR614, the other is the DLink DI-624.</p></li>
<li><p>Workload: many wired connections, many wireless connections. We have 3 wired computers for me and my roommates&#8217; computers, and up to 10 people connected via wireless at the same time (we tend to have a lot of visitors).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After a bit of research, I <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,10664212">found a forum thread online</a> that details how to set it up:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The host router (the Netgear in my case) stays the DHCP server and broadband gateway. Settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assign a static IP on the MAC address of the secondary router. It&rsquo;s 192.168.1.3 on my network. That way you&rsquo;ll always have an IP address to the second router&rsquo;s admin panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Run an Ethernet cable from the host router&rsquo;s LAN port in to the LAN port of the second router (the DLink). (Note: it&rsquo;s especially important that you plug this wire in to the LAN port instead of the WAN port).</p></li>
<li><p>With a computer connected on the network, send your browser on over to the D-Link admin panel at 192.168.1.3. Your settings on the DI-624 should be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;WAN Settings&rdquo; section (Note the 20.2.20.x IP is just a random IP address so the AP doesn&rsquo;t go off and try to dynamically resolve a IP address)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Static IP Address&rdquo; radio button selected</p></li>
<li><p>IP Address: 20.2.20.20</p></li>
<li><p>Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0</p></li>
<li><p>ISP Gateway Address: 20.2.20.21</p></li>
<li><p>Primary DNS address: 20.2.20.22</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;LAN Settings&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Static IP: 192.168.1.3</p></li>
<li><p>Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0</p></li>
<li><p>DNS Relay: Disabled.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;DHCP Settings&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHCP Server: Disabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Wireless&rdquo; section:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up your wireless AP settings however you&rsquo;d like!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Though these instructions are specific to setting up the DI-624, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you could get your old router to work on an existing network.You can now extend the range of your home&rsquo;s wireless network without any fancy signal booster tricks or expensive repeater equipment. How cool is that?</p>
