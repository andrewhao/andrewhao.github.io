  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Spring 2008, I took an information architecture course in the <a href="http://ischool.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>, taught by <a href="http://dret.typepad.com">Erik Wilde</a> (disclaimer: I dropped the course after a month because of schedule conflicts). An interesting part of my research for that class involved investigating the nascent <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE)</a> protocol, a way of organizing groups of resources across the Web. I&rsquo;m going to try to describe in laymen&rsquo;s terms what I learned from my research and explain why it&rsquo;s significant.</p>

<h3>Group things together on the Web</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for a book online. You&rsquo;ll hit up JStor or Google Books and browse through the pages of that book you found. Easy enough, right?</p>

<p>In reality, the <em>physical, electronic representation</em> of the book online is actually more than just &ldquo;that book on JStor&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jstor.com/book">http://www.jstor.com/book</a>&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s actually a collection of images on a Web server. We need a uniform way to descibe that jStor&#8217; specific online version of &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; is actually comprised of &ldquo;page1.jpg&rdquo;, &ldquo;page2.jpg&rdquo;, et cetera.</p>

<p>As another example, let&rsquo;s say that the local public library wants to create a digital representation of its materials on Jimi Hendrix. Well, the library&rsquo;s got Jimi Hendrix CDs, Jimi Hendrix books, Jimi Hendrix magazine articles, and so on. With the OAI-ORE protocol, we can create a digital &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix @ Your Local Public Library&rdquo; object that lists out each CD, book and magazine article contained in the library.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say on top of that, a certain Jimi Hendrix biography references &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; on pages 12, 141 and 254. This &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; object is capable of encoding that reference from those pages to &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Axis: Bold as Love&rdquo; album in the library.</p>

<h3>Why even have a description framework?</h3>

<p>As the Web gets more connected and as we&rsquo;re seeing the rise of interoperable Web services, it becomes increasingly important to have a standard resource description language. Various protocols (such as RDF) have built a foundation on which to describe relationships between electronic resources.</p>

<p>Think of OAI-ORE as a way of organizing information for re-use by others. If every library created its own &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; resource object and made them accessible to others, we could potentially create programs and Web services to collect all &ldquo;Jimi Hendrix&rdquo; objects from across the globe and reconstruct the ultimate, canonical Jimi Hendrix electronic resource library. We could note which books made references to &ldquo;Little Wing.&rdquo; We could view &ldquo;Little Wing&rdquo; as an WMA file, an MP3 file, or as lyrics.</p>

<p>The key is that by standardizing a description language, we <strong>enable programmatic ways to collect and synthesize data</strong> that can potentially add to the value of the world&rsquo;s sum knowledge.</p>

<h3>Resource maps &amp; implementation formats</h3>

<p>OAI-ORE is a specification that defines relationships between resources through an object called the <em>resource map</em>. The resource map is a resource file enumerating a collection of resources and describing the relationships between each resource. Each resource map has its own URI, so it can be discoverable and accessible.</p>

<p>There is no standard file format to encode resource maps. Currently, the OAI-ORE working group has suggested the following description formats (HT: <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/downloads/IT19-Hunter-OAI-ORE-Oct30.ppt">Univ. of Queensland</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF</a> (Resource Description Framework)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard">Atom</a>) syndication format</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://nurture.nature.com/yads">YADS</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/">TriX</a> (RDF triples in XML)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/rdfxml">recommended method of describing a resource map is in RDF/XML</a>. I&rsquo;m not very familiar with the RDF syntax, however, and the TriX format, which affords us RDF triples that can easiliy express relationships between objects and resources, seems to make more sense to me.. However, there is a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.1/atom">complete Atom implementation of the protocol</a>, used when syndication is preferred.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d definitely refer the reader to the <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/downloads/IT19-Hunter-OAI-ORE-Oct30.ppt">Univ. of Queensland&rsquo;s OAI-ORE PDF overview</a> for a broader overview of the protocol and its potential implementations.</p>

<h3>The nitty-gritty</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>Collections</strong>: Multiple resources can be grouped together, but only via an &ldquo;aggregate object&rdquo; or a &ldquo;collection&rdquo;, which maintains pointers to each object in a collection.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong>: Links describe relationships between objects in a resource map, such as &ldquo;has-part&rdquo; (&ldquo;War &amp; Peace &rdquo;-has-part-&ldquo;page 2&rdquo;) or &ldquo;derived-from&rdquo; (&ldquo;Radiohead &ndash; 15 Step Remix&rdquo;-derived-from-&ldquo;Radiohead &ndash; 15 Step&rdquo;). Actual relationships depend on selected vocabularies and namespaces (meaning you can change the link relationships to be whatever you need them to be). There is a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/primer.html#Namespaces">list of default namespaces on the spec</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>I took a high-level and somewhat abstract tack in describing the protocol, and would direct you to the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/primer.html">OAI-ORE Primer</a> for more implementation specifics. Apologies to those of you who were completely lost in this discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited about developing standards like these because resource mapping protocols such as OAI-ORE are an instrumental step in connecting resources, services and information on the Web. They&rsquo;ll help us &ldquo;connect the tubes&rdquo; and create the infrastructure needed to link the world&rsquo;s information together. Now that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to admit, I am an unabashed fan of <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, the new Web browser on the block. Why? UI design that shows attention to detail and a really cool backend architecture that gets a lot of respect from me for tossing convention and rethinking things from the ground up, the way they should have been done.<a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/chrome-resized.png"><img src="http://blog.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/chrome-resized.png" alt="Google Chrome" /></a><a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/chrome-resized.png"></a>Things I like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is so little clutter. There&rsquo;s space for your Web pages and apps to breathe. The search bar and status bar and download pane only slide into view when needed, then they get out of your way so you can keep surfing. I love it.</p></li>
<li><p>The tabs blend right into the title bar and look really, really slick with Windows Vista Aero glass. (Okay, IE7+ gets points for this too).</p></li>
<li><p>You can pop tabs out from a window with a cool mini-screenshot.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiprocessed browsing and using the Vista security model: great ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>V8 Javascript JIT compiling is probably ridiculously complex but reports come in that say it gives us big performance wins.</p></li>
<li><p>Webkit engine = awesomeness (and I didn&rsquo;t even have to work at Apple to say that). Hopefully this will speed CSS3 adoption (and don&rsquo;t even get me started on Webkit&rsquo;s CSS rounded corners and gradients!).</p></li>
<li><p>Great use of (color) contrast: the hostame of the site is given a darker color in the location bar. Everything else is grey. It&rsquo;s all in the details.</p></li>
<li><p>The Omnibar (location bar) just knows what I want to visit. Credit to Firefox&rsquo;s Awesome Bar for introducing us to the concept, but Chrome seems more accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>The downloads bar doesn&rsquo;t open up a new window, but slides up a little bar that lets you glance at what just got downloaded. Awesome.
Needs to improve:</p></li>
<li><p>Gmail keyboard shortcuts seem to lose focus once I hit the &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; key.</p></li>
<li><p>I know everybody&rsquo;s working hard over there, but extensions, please!
So there&rsquo;s a nagging little voice that warns me that Google&rsquo;s seriously going to take over the Interwebs with this killer platform. The other voice in me says to give credit to solid engineering and great design where it&rsquo;s due. This is going to be a game changer, and I&rsquo;m excited to see what&rsquo;s in store for the future.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was commissioned to create graphics for a sermon series titled &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; at my home church, <a href="http://www.gschristian.org/">Good Shepherd</a>. Some of the artists and leaders decided to go with a lantern motif. I went ahead and sketched up these graphics in Illustrator, bumbling around a bit with the <a href="http://createsk8.com/2007/illustrator-tutorial-free-glass-symbol-library/">gradient mesh tool</a> in the process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my IEOR190A class (entrepreneurship), we&rsquo;re developing a business plan of a company making a device that tracks gestures on any surface. Install it on a whiteboard or a chalkboard and boom, your gesture strokes are digitized and recorded on any Bluetooth-enabled computer.</p>

<p>This device is actually implemented right now by our friend Leo Tran in one of his EE classes, using only an LED light and a Wiimote controller. It works by using the infrared camera within the Wiimote to recognize the movement of the LED. The Wiimote then broadcasts its data to a computer via its Bluetooth link.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thinkanywheresketches.jpg"><img src="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thinkanywheresketches.jpg" alt="ThinkAnywhere Design Sketches" /></a></p>

<h5>Some concept sketches, just for fun.</h5>

<p>Now in designing the logo for this product, I wanted to convey a clean feel for the brand. Smooth, swooshy gradients and simple shapes tend to work well for this kind of thing. So I built a chalkboard (the green) and drew our device mounted above the chalkboard. The yellow beam conveys the idea that our device works via camera sensors.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thinkanywhere-icon.jpg"><img src="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/thinkanywhere-icon.jpg" alt="ThinkAnywhere Branding" /></a></p>

<h5>Voila.</h5>

<p>The logo was built entirely in Illustrator. I went with a dark background so the lighter shades of the camera, the IR beam and chalkboard could get a &ldquo;pop&rdquo;. The font you see there is Colaborate Bold&mdash;it&rsquo;s nicely <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/24/five-more-freefonts-chucara-preface-colaborate/">given out for free</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I remember why I love and hate assembling computers.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to love the rush of building something cool. The anticipation of the new BIOS screen&mdash;blue letters on black indicating some really high memory size and clock frequency. You are your very own Dr. Frankenstein and the monster is about to liiiiiive&hellip;</p>

<p>But more frequently than not, it plays out like this: after scanning the electronics ads (<a href="http://slickdeals.net">Slickdeals</a>, <a href="http://dealnews.com">Dealnews</a>, the ever-present <a href="http://newspaperads.mercurynews.com/ROP/ads.aspx?advid=32664">Fry&rsquo;s ads on the back of the San Jose Mercury</a>) for what seems like years, you finally get the courage to splurge a couple hundred bucks on assorted parts. You&rsquo;ve done your research; the heatsink fan <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> collide with the on-board capacitors, your brand of memory doesn&rsquo;t have any motherboard compatibility errors, your motherboard manufacturer is of good repute and doesn&rsquo;t, for the first time, have parts from some no-name Chinese manufacturer (okay, so this is me speaking here).</p>

<p>You get your parts, and spend a couple of hours putting it all together. You painstakingly push clips into place, apply thermal grease as needed, silently curse the motherboard powers-that-be that pack front panel pin connectors so closely together. Your fingers grow raw from turning the screwdriver so many times. You wonder to yourself whether you&rsquo;ll somehow accidentally fry some component by putting it on the table, or whether if by accidentally scraping your screwdriver across the PCB you&rsquo;ve just junked your expensive toy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the gory details. But essentially, what usually happens is you get it all Assembled Together after an hour or so and then comes the Moment of Truth: you push the power button to witness your machine come gloriously to life and, in a wonderful demonstration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy&rsquo;s Law</a>, one or more of the following will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> You witness a bright flash of light, then smoke rises out from the PCB.</p></li>
<li><p> Your computer will beep at you. Continuously. The screen will stay off, just for dramatic effect.</p></li>
<li><p> Midway through the OS installation, your computer will freeze.</p></li>
<li><p> Your hard drive gets corrupted from a rogue reboot.</p></li>
<li><p> Nothing.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>By the way, these have all happened to me at some point(s) in time.</p>

<p>After aforementioned catastrophe, you exhale deeply, clench your fists and then proceed to Pinpoint The Problem.</p>

<p>Remember the Scientific Method? Remember how you had to isolate one variable&mdash;the independent variable&mdash;while keeping everything else at a &ldquo;control&rdquo;? Well here&rsquo;s the part where you scrounge up all available parts and start switching them in and out, testing each component one by one to see which part the problem resides in.</p>

<p>I hate the Scientific Method.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where you begin the Gradual Spiral Into Despair. It&rsquo;s the sinking feeling you get after a couple of days you realize that you still don&rsquo;t know what the problem is. Look at you, a loner in your room surrounded by junky computer parts all over the place. You&rsquo;ve got red eyes from lack of sleep and staring at monitors. You haven&rsquo;t seen a human being in two days. And when was the last time you showered?</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s all worth it when you emerge on the other side, bruised and broken but victorious.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to the ones who nevertheless press on. Here&rsquo;s to the ones who will rather take a bullet than give up on your rig. Here&rsquo;s to the ones who scoff at light and food and warmth and human companionship. Here&rsquo;s to you, True Geek. You&rsquo;ve got your scars, now here&rsquo;s your reward: Dual Cores of Computing Sweetness. It&rsquo;s rather worth it, won&rsquo;t you say? Right?</p>

<p>Hey, you still there?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think I must preface this post with a bit of context:</p>

<p>A month ago I added a new blog (<a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com">blog.andrewhao.com</a>). I wanted that blog to become my personal blog and let this blog (<a href="http://blog.g9labs.com">blog.g9labs.com</a>) transition into a technical blog.</p>

<p>Here comes a technical post about transforming a personal blog into a technical blog.</p>

<p>So here were the problem(s) I faced:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of my posts here at blog.g9labs.com were of personal nature, many which dated all the way back to 2002, my sophomore year of high school!</p></li>
<li><p>However, I had begun to write technical posts for a year or two&mdash;some thoughts on interface design, an occasional programming trick, cool regex expressions, et cetera.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of my posts have been linked all around the Internet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Essentially, I wanted to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Move the personal contents of the g9labs blog to the andrewhao blog,</p></li>
<li><p>While keeping all in-links to old g9labs content alive.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My solution was two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I made a copy of my g9Labs<em> blog to the andrewhao blog. This was harder than I anticipated&mdash;I initially expected to simply use the WP export plugin to dump data from g9Labs</em> and import into andrewhao. However, this lost much of my metadata&mdash;comments, categories, tags. So I just decided to completely copy my g9Labs* WP database and WP directory into andrewhao. Yeah, hacky, I know. I&rsquo;m not very proud of it.</p></li>
<li><p> I added an .htaccess file to blog.g9labs.com that did some magic. It identifies requests for posts that are earlier than the date of the blog fork and redirects those requests to andrewhao.com, which is hosting a mirror of the post.</p>

<h1>redirecting requests to posts older than 2008-02-02 to blog.andrewhao.com</h1>

<h1>pass the requester a 301 code (permanently removed)</h1>

<h1>@author: Andrew Hao</h1>

<h1>Lexically compare regex groups $1-$3 with the date: Feb. 03, 2008.</h1>

<h1>Note that the RewriteRule below is reached only if the condition is true.</h1>

<h1>Finally, note that $1-$3 are regex groups from the RewriteRule regex below.</h1>

<p>RewriteCond $1$2$3 &lt;20080203</p>

<h1>Match the incoming request: /YYYY/MM/DD/post-title and redirect the browser</h1>

<h1>to <a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title">http://blog.andrewhao.com/YYYY/MM/DD/post-title</a></h1>

<p>RewriteRule ^([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)/([^/]+)/*$ <a href="http://blog.andrewhao.com/$1">http://blog.andrewhao.com/$1</a>
/$2/$3/$4/ [L,R=301]
&hellip; rest of .htaccess &hellip;</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My apartmentmate Mike just upgraded his computer to an Intel Core 2 Quad-core processor. Once he got it up and running, he opened up Task Manager and summoned me over to gaze at the beauty of four CPU utilization graphs, one for each core. We had to fight the urge to beat our chests and make low, guttural grunts.</p>

<p>Welcome to 2008, may he who has the most cores win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Morning: Woke up and attempted to mount a Samba file share under Ubuntu.</h3>

<p>My Gutsy server in the living room is getting a second life as a backup file server. I need to mount it in my filesystem so I can rsync certain directories on my desktop over to the server.</p>

<p><code>mount -t //my_server_ip/share_folder /media/mount_folder</code></p>

<p>Alas! I couldn&rsquo;t get write access into the mount point! At first I thought this was a chmod problem, so I added myself as the mount_folder owner.</p>

<p><code>sudo chown username mount_folder/</code></p>

<p>To no avail. So then I attempted to use the &ldquo;permit all&rdquo; chmod sledgehammer:</p>

<p><code>sudo chmod 777 mount_folder/</code></p>

<p>Argh! STILL no good!</p>

<p>So then I went back to the drawing board and did some investigating. I could, 50% of the time, gain write access to child subfolders on the Samba share via GNOME Nautilus interface (smb://my_server_ip). Weird! Was this a Samba config problem? I didn&rsquo;t have the cajones to find out.</p>

<p>As a last-ditch attempt, I tried to modify my fstab file to mount the Samba share (I read somewhere that the uid and gid option flags give you the win). Side note: you can find your username&rsquo;s uid and gid numbers from the <code>/etc/passwd file</code>.</p>

<pre><code># TEMPORARY SAMBA SHARE FROM LIVINGROOM SERVER

# @author Andrew

//my_server_ip/archive /media/archive smbfs noauto,rw,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
</code></pre>

<p><em>Still</em> no good! Arghs! At this point, I gave up and simply SFTP-ed in to dump my files. Admitting defeat is a sad, sad thing.</p>

<h3>Afternoon: Designed some logo comps for a Web company.</h3>

<p><a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/logo.png"><img src="http://blog.g9labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/logo.png" alt="Logo I started on." /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working under contract from Ryan Waliany. This site should be doing some cool things. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t reveal too much. All this to say that I&rsquo;ve taken a long hiatus from design and I really miss it.</p>

<h3>Late Afternoon: Set up Google Apps for g9labs.com</h3>

<p>I gave in to the hype, and began setting up a Google Apps For Your Domain (GFYD) account for this g9labs site, primarily so I can hook into the awesome GMail interface instead of being chained to the Thunderbird client.</p>

<p>This was a multi-step process of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Verifying ownership of your domain. </strong>Google has you modify a CNAME entry on your domain so they can ping it to check that it&rsquo;s changed. I marched happily over to the <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> panel where I found the DNS page for <a href="http://g9labs.com">g9labs.com</a>. There I added a CNAME value of googlexxxxxxxxx (a unique value given to you) and set its CNAME value to &ldquo;google.com&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p> While Google takes 48 hours to verify you&rsquo;ve done the right steps, you can go ahead and <strong>modify the MX records for your domain </strong>so mail gets sent on over to Google instead of your Dreamhost server. This was easily set in the Dreamhost panel under Mail >> MX Records. You change your MX records to Google&rsquo;s special MX server, and you&rsquo;re on your way!</p></li>
<li><p> I&rsquo;m waiting for verification to go through, then I&rsquo;ll talk about how to get <strong>IMAP for GFYD working</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
