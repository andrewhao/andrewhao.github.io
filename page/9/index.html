<p>I want to write a <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com">Rhapsody</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/">scrobbler</a>. It&rsquo;s already been done as a <a href="http://www.atlansky.com/dev/rhapsodyscrobbler.html">desktop application</a>, but I don&rsquo;t want to boot up another application while I&rsquo;m playing music. I want to do it as a hosted Web service.</p>

<p>Does anybody want to look into this? I&rsquo;m thinking the design would be simple: regularly consume the Rhapsody user&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/myrhapsody/feeds.html">Tracks RSS feed</a> and plug it into AudioScrobbler via its <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/">API</a>.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2007/04/29/taiwan-roundup-ii/">Taiwan Roundup II</a></h1>
		<time>29 April 2007</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/230/467031358_e06878d13b.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>

<p>After weeks of being stuck in a really deep rut, I&rsquo;ve finally stumbled upon something that&rsquo;s decently interesting with regards to the state of the Taiwanese blogsophere (this is <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/567102707/item.html">an assignment</a> for my International Media class). I&rsquo;m finally following up on what <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/572967146/taiwan-roundup.html">I previously discussed</a> with regards to the state of the Taiwanese blogosphere. I&rsquo;ll be running a textual analysis.on Chinese and English blogs as they cover the controversy over the closing of the Losheng sanitorium.</p>

<p>The Losheng (ï¿½Ö¥ï¿½) sanitorium, a structure built to house <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy">lepers</a> during Japan&rsquo;s occupation of Taiwan (still housing many today) is a memorial to Taiwan&rsquo;s history (also serving as a reminder of suppressed human rights). In 1994, a plan was drafted to build a rail yard for the MRT transit system over the sanitorium, effectively demolishing and destroying it. The scheduled demolition date was April 15, 2007, but an extraordinary upswell of protest (largely coordinated and managed online) managed to <a href="http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20070317_1.htm">raise money and awareness of the decision</a>, pleading to preserve the sanitorium out of respect for remaining patients and preservation of a historical location. A day before the 4/15 deadline, the decision was delayed and reconsidered. Two things are significant about this:</p>

<ol>
<li> It is a testament to the power of the Internet as a new social space (think: Web 2.0). The activists banded together via <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/04/15/taiwan-bloggers-further-action-on-saving-losheng-sanatorium/">each other&rsquo;s blogs</a>, posting Web banners, <a href="http://www.hemidemi.com/bookmark/info/541029#">starting discussions on social bookmarking sites</a>, talking in <a href="http://www.socialforce.tw/phpBB/post_480342.html">activist forums</a>, posting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CYsydqHZkg&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">online videos</a> and took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/losheng/">scads of photos</a> to raise awareness. One dude even <a href="http://www.oikos.com.tw/losheng/losheng_all.php?ad=%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E7%B8%A3%E6%96%B0%E8%8E%8A%E5%B8%82%E4%B8%AD%E6%AD%A3%E8%B7%AF794%E8%99%9F">wrote up a UrMaps (think Google Maps) mashup</a> that mapped social destinations and places of interest over the Losheng area to generate public interest. The momentum caught the interest of the mainstream media, giving momentum to <a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/03/11/taiwan-bloggers-act-on-saving-lo-sheng-sanatorium/">several protests</a> that were marched.</li>
<li> It demonstrates the divide between the English and Chinese blogger cultures in Taiwan. I covered most of this in the <a href="http://www.xanga.com/gsgnine/572967146/taiwan-roundup.html">previous post</a>, but most of the significant English-speaking bloggers (mainly expats) gave either <a href="http://michaelturton.blogspot.com/search?q=losheng">cursory coverage</a> or no coverage to the issue, at all (a quick sweep of all <a href="http://technorati.com/search/losheng">Technorati bloggers blogging &ldquo;losheng&rdquo;</a> returns hardly any expat blogs.) This isn&rsquo;t to say that they aren&rsquo;t sensitive to the issue, but there seems to be a very large divide, particularly due to language and cultural differences.</li>
</ol>


<p>So that&rsquo;s the theoretical start to a paper that gets harder to write the longer I do research. Dang, what a week.</p>

			<p><a href="http://blog.g9labs.com/index.php?page=showcomments&amp;id=5">Way back when I started blogging</a> soph year of high school (it&rsquo;s been five+ years!), I pointed out that the public act of blogging helped me &ldquo;get my thoughts straight&rdquo; and gave me a &ldquo;lil sense of closure at the end of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things have changed. Life&rsquo;s been busy. It&rsquo;s been hard finding time to pause, reflect and put metaphorical pen to paper.</p>

<p>I try to be as candid as possible but I have to be honest: it&rsquo;s hard here. I might attribute it to the blinding lights of Xanga and its close-knit community that is both a blessing and a curse. Here I find an audience, but at times I know I must hold back. Maybe that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>Do you remember? We were freckle-faced high schoolers tumbling over China, our obnoxious American mannerisms betraying our origins despite our butter skin. We had agreed to stay in shape during that trip, so the first night one of us had the bright idea to do stairwell repeats up the fire escape. So we laced up our sneakers and bounded up the stairs two by two, laughing between breaths, running single file and breathing musty cigarette air. I remember losing count of the stairs we had climbed, unfocusing my eyes and watching each set of steps blur by in my field of vision, wondering when I would fall. I didn&rsquo;t. By the twenty-fifth floor the stairs ended and we poured out onto the rooftop of Beijing, stars bright as our eyes, daring each other to look down at the maze of city streets below. Some of us pantomimed a fall. We didn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2007/03/28/verilogical/">Verilogical</a></h1>
		<time>28 March 2007</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Oftentimes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a> code, we build testbenches (test fixtures). A common thing to do is to instantiate a module and plug in wires of the same names.</p>

<p>Now a common hack is to copy and paste the module declaration line (the &ldquo;prototype,&rdquo; if you will). The prototype looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>module    Foo(    bar,<br></br>       baz,<br></br>       &hellip;<br></br>    );  <br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>The HDL synthesizer can correctly wire inputs, regardless of instantiated order, by surrounding the names of the local wires with the input names as declared in the prototype in a format such as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Foo foo_instance (    .bar(bar),<br></br>         .baz(baz),<br></br>         &hellip;<br></br>        );<br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>So to do so is a rather painful matter of adding a period before the input name, copy and pasting the input name and pasting it after the name, bracketed by parentheses.</p>

<p>But what do you do if your module has thirty inputs? Our previous solution was to surrender our wrists to inevitable Repetitive Stress Injuries. Today, I realized that I should have used a freakin&#8217; elementary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Search:       (.*),<br></br>Replace:  .$1($1),<br></br></p></blockquote>

<p>Wah-lah! I&rsquo;m kicking myself for not thinking of this earlier. And it has taken me 10 minutes to tell you how I saved forty-five seconds and my poor wrists. Anything to avoid more work (shh, don&rsquo;t tell Alex) :)</p>

		<time>27 February 2007</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I have friends who run a cost-benefit analysis on every decision. And they&rsquo;re always measuring things up against Time. Freakin, Endless, Time. I think I&rsquo;m one of them, too. May it never be so.</p>

<hr />

<p>I remember why I&rsquo;ve never liked the stacks: these chairs are pretty much the least ergonomic chairs ever built, on par with medieval torture devices.</p>

<p>I remember why I&rsquo;ve missed the stacks: being here makes me feel smarter. And how time somehow seems to stands still, but that might be the artificial lighting and the fact I&rsquo;m fifty feet underground.</p>

<hr />

<p>There was a study done a long time ago where a woman volunteered to live underground for like a month. And they measured her sleep cycles, and it went wack by about a week (can anybody name this study or correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong?). I always wondered what kind of music you&rsquo;d listen to if you were underground for that long. And if she ever figured out how to work a Rubik&rsquo;s cube. Being underground for that long seems like a good way to determine cube optimization strategies.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh, essay. The closer I get to the end, the harder it gets to write. 9 pages down, three to go and I&rsquo;ll either finish in one hour or in six.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit: it was six.</p>
