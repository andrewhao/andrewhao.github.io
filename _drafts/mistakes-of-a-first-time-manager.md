<h2 class="intro">It's been several years since I've come off of my former role as an engineering manager, and with enough humble introspection I've had several insights into the mistakes I've made, and how I'm integrating those learnings into my teams nowadays.</h2>

### How it all began

Several years have passed since I first inadvertently found myself in engineering management. My boss sat me down in a room and told me he was leaving, and that he wanted me to take his place. Would I be up for the challenge?

I told him I'd think about it, then went home and started freaking out. My boss was so important to the company. Was everything going to fall apart without him? Would I be able to fill his shoes? What if I couldn't?

I came back the next morning and told him I was up for it. A few days later, I was on my own. There was going to be a steep learning curve and plenty of bumps on the road. Sure enough, I made more than a few mistakes.

### 1. Trying to build silos and defenses

The company at the time was in a pretty bad spot. Revenue was plateauing, and morale was kind of meh. We'd experienced a bunch of turnover, and things weren't looking like they were getting better.

At the time, the project management team had a reputation for being pretty heavy-handed with the Project Managing™️ and had clashed with my boss. Hard. I knew where my boss was coming from, and agreed with his approach. However, his personal style was pretty brusque and aggressive, and it really showed. He clashed often with other stakeholders in the company.

One of the first things I did as a manager was to start the team doing retrospectives, but doing so apart from the rest of the product delivery organization. I honestly felt like our working relationship was not in a productive place, and I feared that my team would not be able to honestly voice their opinions out in the open. So I told everybody - we would be doing our reflections and retrospectives on our own. Closed doors. It felt like the right thing to do at the time, with the uncertainty of transition, I just didn't trust other people to be able to hear my team out.

The problem with huddling in a defensive posture is that I didn't end up trusting other people to be present in the room, give people the space to voice their opinions, and become an improving organization. I had also projected my internal beliefs and (mis)understandings of the rest of the product delivery organization and assumed worst intention from them, instead of assuming the best.

*Lesson learned*: Overcome fear by posturing the team with a learning mindset and a framework for honest communication.

### 2. Not being more open-minded in hiring, or missing the hidden weights that make someone hireable

I have some regret that my hiring practices may have turned down some potentially great candidates who may have just needed some coaching, mentoring and placement on a great team.

As I took on more and more hiring responsibilities, my team and I decided on some criteria we wanted for prospective candidates. They had to excel at data structures. Have a great nose at OO design. Understand best practices. So we crafted this interview process that tested for a bunch of those hard skills.

However, sometimes we'd come up against a candidate that didn't really have the skills to qualify for the role in our ranks, but had a fantastic personality or a curiosity to learn. When trying to make the hiring decision, I oftentimes found myself picturing this candidate in the mindset of "could this person kick butt tomorrow on my team?", but never asking "given 6 months on our team, could this person really grow into that engineer?"

I did once hire a junior engineer fresh out of boot camp who later went on to become one of our most effective engineers on the team. It was a credit to her teachability, curiosity and collaboration skills that gave her a career trajectory far higher than I originally estimated for her.

*Lesson learned*: Hire for the engineer you may have six months down the line, not necessarily the engineer you see now. Prioritize empathy, curiosity, and teachability - not just career experience.


### 3. Avoiding critical feedback for my engineers

I had one engineer who, for the life of me, I could not figure out how to motivate. He seemed to just surf the web all day and goof off (my perspective). When asked to do work, he'd crank out some code (that was pretty decent), but it would lack tests or would be overlooking some key requirement in the story.

In our one-on-ones, I would dance around the topic. "You do good work, but you missed some requirements here and there". "Good job on delivering X. I hope we can give you a big project Y, but I think that PR stayed out a bit too long. Let's keep our eye on the ball."

But people were, in fact, noticing. I needed to give him more critical, crucial feedback that would light a fire under him.

What I needed to tell him was, "Hey, you're underperforming and people are noticing. I need you to rein in your web surfing and pitch in with some solid work. I know you're capable of doing this - let's focus on testability this week...". Because if I didn't give him this feedback now, he'd just end up hurting our team's morale. And he'd take this behavior with him to his next job.

*Lesson learned*: direct, actionable feedback from a place of genuine care is a crucial component of great management (see Kim Scott's excellent book, [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)).
