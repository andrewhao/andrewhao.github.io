<h2 class="intro">A discussion about why I enjoy working in the XP-school of Agile, but hey, that's just me.</h2>

Several articles have been circulating recently in the Agile community critiquing the current state of the practice (see: ["The State of Agile Software in 2018" - Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html) and ["Developer Should Abandon Scrum" - Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/)). At their core, they are really saying the same thing - Agile, as originally intended, was meant to be a living, breathing, _freeing_ process for the team. Compare that to the rigorous imposed frameworks deployed across organizations these days.

Long ago[1], I worked at a company that deployed Scrum across the entire company. This wasn't some mega-corporate behemoth, it was a mid-stage startup that had been around for a good while. But it was struggling. Teams across the org weren't working the same way. It was hard to pin down milestones and delivery dates and coordinate work the same way. Some engineering teams worked in an ad-hoc, Kanban-ish way. Others were more centralized, top-down planning. Project managers wanted more predictibility in our delivery platforms.

And lo, an Agile working group was formed, and they chose to roll out Scrum. And to be honest, the implementation of Scrum we chose wasn't a bad one. A process was rolled out in which we all used JIRA, had regular planning meetings, standups, retrospectives and all that jazz. But something still wasn't sitting well with me.

We assigned stories to engineers at our planning meetings. "Oh, Jay is good at the payments system, so he'll take this story". Jay mumbles something in agreement. "Esther knows infrastructure items better, so she'll handle the deployment tasks on this task." And Esther would do it. But pre-assigning stories would lead to knowledge silos, and creating these false boundaries of what was "acceptable" to work on.

Our project manager - bless her soul - would attempt to answer big questions through Scrum in a way that abused it. We were asked to estimate stories three sprints out so a delivery date could be given to upper management and other stakeholders. Of course, we would always miss these targets. (Once, we were asked to estimate the scope of an entire project by interring the entire team in a room and writing out six months' worth of stories!)

It was clear that Scrum had brought some wins. Retrospectives really were introducing a feeling of continual improvement and shared accomplishment. Estimating stories was helpful in raising conversations to the fore that would help the team arrive at an accurate estimate.
