The first question you may be asking is - *why would I want to go from
Rails to Java*?

Maybe you don't have a choice. Maybe you started a new job. Maybe you
heard Java was the new, old hotness. In any case, you're a Ruby on Rails
developer and you're looking Java in the face.

### The languages

First off, Rails and Java share similar philosophies.

You may argue that Java is the One True Language for old-fashioned
Object-Oriented Programming. The existence of strong types lead to
powerful expressions around OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism,
and the like.

Java and Ruby share similar philosophies - in that Everything Is An
Object. In Ruby, the `nil` value is modeled as a `NilClass`. In Java,
objects abound everywhere.

### The frameworks

I can't speak from firsthand experience, but Java developers will tell
you that developing Java apps in the early 2000s was like configuration
soup. Everything was explicit and configured in XML.

Spring Boot arguable moves the state of the art in Java frameworks more
towards' Rails' philosophies - that convention trumps configuration. It
accomplishes this through *annotations* - more on this later.

Rails was precisely so groundbreaking and exciting in 2005 because it
was everything Java was not - terse, expressive, and unapologetically
convention-driven. Where in Java, everything was explicitly traceable
through system calls, Rails used magic methods of dynamically-defined
methods, monkey-patching and big ol' global God Objects to accomplish
its magic.
