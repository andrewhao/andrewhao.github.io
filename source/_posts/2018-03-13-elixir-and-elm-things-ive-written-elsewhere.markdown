While it's been pretty quiet around these parts, I've kept the technical blogging up over on [my employer's blog](https://blog.carbonfive.com). I've got quite a few posts around Elixir:

[Lightweight dependency injection in Elixir (without the tears)](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2018/03/19/lightweight-dependency-injection-in-elixir-without-the-tears/): What are some ways we can use the language features of Elixir to apply small-scale dependency injection patterns, without a ton of ceremony?

[Functional Mocks with Mox in Elixir](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2018/01/16/functional-mocks-with-mox-in-elixir/): This post discusses a mocking library in Elixir called [mox](https://github.com/plataformatec/mox) that adheres to the Elixir Way(tm) of mocking (that is, the usage of fakes or doubles).

[Comparing Dynamic Supervision Strategies in Elixir 1.5 and 1.6](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2018/01/30/comparing-dynamic-supervision-strategies-in-elixir-1-5-and-1-6/): In this blog post, I discuss the benefits of the new `DynamicSupervisor` module in Elixir 1.6 and how it makes the supervision of a dynamically-scaled supervision tree easier to set up.

Finally, I wrote ["Taking Elm for a Test Drive"](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/10/25/taking-elm-for-a-test-drive/) about playing around with Elm, giving my take on the trajectory of the language.
