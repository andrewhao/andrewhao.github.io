I should have mentioned this long ago, but I started work at Blurb in early August. It's been a quick ramp-up and I'm loving it there, surrounded by smart engineers and great designers. I do Rails/JS work there, and I'm building a lot of chops around Agile/TDD methodologies.

Anyways, they had me do a Camera Thursdays blog post, which I [wrote about my Nikon/1.8 camera combo](http://blog.blurb.com/index.php/2011/11/17/blurberati-with-cameras-nikon-d80-with-f1-8-50mm-prime/):
