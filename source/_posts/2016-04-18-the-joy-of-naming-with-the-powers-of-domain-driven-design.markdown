I want to discuss a topic near and dear to my heart, and what I believe
core to the crux of software design. It's not a new functional language,
it's not a fancy new framework, nor is it a leap of computational
powers in the fields of machine learning or artificial intelligence.

It's much simpler.

It's about names.

![In the beginning...](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rL73HKlqbH0/TKhVHMbs2oI/AAAAAAAABEc/DiPbblM0R44/s1600/sistine-chapel-michelangelo-paintings-6.jpg)

*Names define us*. They define concepts. They imbue a concept with
shared understanding. They're language concepts, but more than that,
they're units of meaning.

Software development is a fundamentally human endeavour. No matter how much our
field will progress, software development is still the arduous task of
getting a team together full of humans from a kaleidescope of different
cultural, linguistic backgrounds and throwing them together to define a
thing to build.

Not only that, the thing to build is chock-full of systems that
interact with other systems of unbounded complexity. Additionally, once
your software system is out in the wild, you need to make sure that it
was the right thing to build. Is the product you built correctly tuned
to your market? Is it generating sufficient revenue?

It's no wonder that developing reliable, successful software is more
of an art than a science.

Let's rewind back to a scene from a typical day in the life of your
software development team. Think back to the last time you discussed a story
with your product owner, how did it unfold?

PO: So our next company focus is to update our routing engine to route
all our drivers to their passengers based on the passenger's .

You: OK, so that means we'll need to refresh the WhizBang tables with
updated FooID references from the PassengerBaz service.

PO: Um... I guess so?
