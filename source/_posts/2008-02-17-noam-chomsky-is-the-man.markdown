Why?

The man is a respected thinker, theorist and activist. I've had several Mass Communications classes devote a couple of sections to his thoughts about mass media and its effect in forming dissent and complacency in the masses.

The man took a period of his life in the 50's devoted to formalizing computer languages (he is by profession, a linguist). We just went over [Chomsky normal form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_normal_form) in my CS164 (compilers) course--a recursive method for generating languages from a set of rules.

My CS and humanities world collide, but this man has done it way before. How stunning. [Noam Chomsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) is The Man.

(Disclaimer: I don't agree with very many of his views, but the purpose of this post is to point out that Mr. Chomsky is a man who's pretty much Done It All).
