Since I'm in the process of doing some housekeeping around the blog, I've begun moving my [old design portfolio over to Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/sets/72157602687541585/).

This is sort of an intermediary step to another intermediary step of overhauling my portfolio (yeah, I've been meaning to do this for the past five years). Watch this space for updated project briefs to come trickling in.
