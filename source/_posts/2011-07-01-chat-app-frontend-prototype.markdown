Some UI work I did for a stealth startup in early '11. Responsible for look & feel and frontend chat interactions. jQuery/UI communicating to a CakePHP/nodejs backend.

We developed this prototype with [statecharts](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf), a concept commonly found in event-driven programming and with which I first learned from [Sproutcore](http://frozencanuck.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/sproutcore-statecharts-vs-controllers/). I found it really helped map out all the complex user interactions we had to deal with on the page.
