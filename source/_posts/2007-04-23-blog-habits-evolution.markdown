[Way back when I started blogging](http://blog.g9labs.com/index.php?page=showcomments&id=5) soph year of high school (it's been five+ years!), I pointed out that the public act of blogging helped me "get my thoughts straight" and gave me a "lil sense of closure at the end of the day."   
  
Things have changed. Life's been busy. It's been hard finding time to pause, reflect and put metaphorical pen to paper.  
  
I try to be as candid as possible but I have to be honest: it's hard here. I might attribute it to the blinding lights of Xanga and its close-knit community that is both a blessing and a curse. Here I find an audience, but at times I know I must hold back. Maybe that's okay.
