My apartmentmate Mike just upgraded his computer to an Intel Core 2 Quad-core processor. Once he got it up and running, he opened up Task Manager and summoned me over to gaze at the beauty of four CPU utilization graphs, one for each core. We had to fight the urge to beat our chests and make low, guttural grunts.

Welcome to 2008, may he who has the most cores win.
