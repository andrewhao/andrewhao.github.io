Hi, I'm Andrew. Nice to meet you. You may know me from the one-man design/development shop [g9Labs* Design Studio](http://www.g9labs.com), specializing in graphic/interface design and Web applications.

You may also know me as one of the guys behind [Wejoinin](http://www.wejoinin.com), the easy way to make a signup sheet online. I do the design and programming and talk to our users who need help.

I'm affiliated with the [Porkbuns Initiative](http://www.porkbuns.net), a group of friends who met at UC Berkeley who like to build swift, sleek Web applications.

I graduated in the class of 2008 from [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) (go Bears!), studying Electrical Engineering Computer Science and Mass Communications.

I'm currently in the middle of a gap year, on volunteer staff at [Regeneration Church Oakland](http://www.regenerationweb.com), and a part-time freelancer in my free time.

Don't worry, I'm still really, really excited about making things pretty.Â I kind of like being a designer/developer/artist/programmer. Sure, it's not much of a title. But I wake up every day and can't wait to get started.
