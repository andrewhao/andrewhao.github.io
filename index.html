			<h3 id="an-introduction-to-every-parents-trial-and-travails">An introduction to every parent’s trial and travails</h3>

<p>When our son was born early last year, I admit I wasn’t ready for it. Fatherhood was not the kind of thing I was ready for (and who really can ever be ready for parenthood, anyways?).</p>

<p>It so turns out that the vast majority of the first year of parenting is simply enduring the gut-wrenching cries of your little one. And cry they do - crying when they are too tired, screaming when they are too energetic, crying when they are gassy, screaming when they are bored, and crying when they just pooped.</p>

<p>The trials that Annie and I went through with our little guy was particularly difficult on us (you can ask me in person if we ever get to chat). The little guy was a prolific screamer and absolutely. hated. sleep.</p>

<p>What’s a geeky dad to do? Quantify household suffering by leveraging machine learning, of course.</p>

<p>I set out to build a system that would in the end determine how well our little guy slept through (or didn’t sleep through) the night. I started by building a system that naively parsed audio samples from his nursery, and then trained a TensorFlow model to do more accurate detection of his cries. Here’s how it worked:</p>

<h3 id="act-1-the-misery-meter">Act 1: The Misery Meter</h3>

<p>In version 1 of the system, I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kinobo-Microphone-Desktop-Recognition-Software/dp/B00IR8R7WQ">a cheap USB microphone</a> and hooked it up to a Raspberry Pi 3.</p>

<p>In it, I loaded up a script to record a 30-second audio sample, using the <code>arecord</code> UNIX command line tool:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">set</span> -euxo pipefail
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="nv">DIR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$( cd &quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span> dirname <span class="s2">&quot;${BASH_SOURCE[0]}&quot;</span> <span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot; &amp;&amp; pwd )&quot;</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nv">RECORDING_FILE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;${DIR}/recordings/sample.wav&quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>…then I ran the <code>sox</code> command-line tool to grab some simple loudness statistics out from it:</p>

<figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>In case you’re curious, here’s the full output from <code>sox -V3 FILE -n stats</code>. Pretty nifty:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Here, we’re really only interested in <code>RMS dB</code>, which is the relative loudness levels within this 30-second sample. I chose to push these three stats up to a web service which I use to aggregate and graph these metrics. <code>RMS lev</code> is the average, <code>RMS Pk</code> is the peak, and <code>RMS Tr</code> is the trough (the floor).</p>

<p>I’m not showing the entirety of the script, but the last thing it does is parse and push the results of the analysis of this audio sample to a Web-based metrics aggregation service! In case you were wondering, I have an API service sitting between the Raspberry Pi and a time-series API supplied by <a href="https://www.keen.io">Keen.io</a>. But the main point is that now I can load up a cute JS widget that graphs these data points!</p>

<p><img src="/images/tensorflow-for-tears/audio-graph.png" alt="Audio crying graph" /></p>

<p>Now, how does one read this graph?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can follow the peaks of the audio signal and assume that any noise over a certain dB threshold is the little dude’s screaming.</li>
  <li>We can follow the troughs of the graph and assume that if the trough jumps, then man there is some serious crying going on, since the audio floor of the soundscape has been bumped up!</li>
  <li>Or we can follow the average RMS reading and assume some combination of the two?</li>
</ul>

<p>The truth of the matter, none of the readings from the Misery Meter (so I called it) were particularly reliable indicators of “the little buddy is crying his little head off”. Sometimes, his crying was at the same volume level as other ambient noises in the house (say, when he’s playing in the other room and someone shuts a door). So it turns out that using volume as a proxy for crying is insufficient to give us reliable results.</p>

<h3 id="act-2-enter-tensorflow-next">Act 2: Enter TensorFlow… next!</h3>

<p>In my next post, I’ll discuss how I modified this script to use TensorFlow to train a model that could then be used to enhance the accuracy of little dude’s crying. Stick around, it’ll be fun!</p>

		<h1><a href="/2017/07/19/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-moving-to-async-systems/">Pitfalls to avoid when moving to async systems</a></h1>
		<time>19 July 2017</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I recently published a post on the <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com">Carbon Five blog</a> titled <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/07/18/evented-rails-decoupling-complex-domains-in-rails-with-domain-events/">“Evented Rails: Decoupling complex domains in Rails with Domain Events”</a> that takes some of my thoughts about moving a Rails app to use Domain Events - leveraging the power of Sidekiq (or your job runner of choice) to send async messages between different domains of your app.</p>

<p>This approach always seems nice from the outset, but can hide some painful complexities if you go too far down the rabbit hole. Here is a repost of the latter half of that article, which is worth repeating:</p>

<h2 id="big-wins-of-the-async-model-speed--scalability">Big win[s of the async model]: speed &amp; scalability</h2>

<p>By splitting out domain logic into cohesive units, we’ve just designed our systems to farm out their workloads to a greater scalable number of workers. Imagine if you had a web request thread that would take 500ms to return, but 150ms of that time was spent doing a round trip to a different service. By decoupling that work from the main request thread and moving it to a background job – we’ve just sped up the responsiveness of our system for our end user, and we know that studies have shown that page speed performance equals money.</p>

<p>Additionally, making our application calls asynchronous allows us to scale the number of processing power we allocate to our system. We now have the ability to horizontally scale workers according to the type of job, or the domain they are working from. This may result in cost and efficiency savings as we match processing power to the workload at hand.</p>

<h2 id="big-challenge-dealing-with-asynchronous-data-flows">Big challenge: dealing with asynchronous data flows</h2>

<p>Once things go async, we now have a fundamentally different data design. For example, say you implemented an HTTP API endpoint that performed some action in the system synchronously. However, now you’ve farmed out the effects of the action to background processes through domain events. While this is great for response times, you’ve now no longer got the guarantees to the caller that the desired side effect has been performed once the server responds back.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-polling">Asynchronous polling</h3>

<p>An option is to implement the Polling pattern. The API can return a request identifier back to the caller on first call, with which which the caller can now query the API for the result status. If the result is not ready, the API service will return with a Nack message, or negative Ack, implying that the result data has not arrived yet. As soon as the results in the HTTP API are ready, the API will correctly return the result.</p>

<h3 id="pubsub-all-the-way-down">Pub/Sub all the way down</h3>

<p>Another option is to embrace the asynchronous nature of the system wholly and transition the APIs to event-driven, message-based systems instead. In this paradigm, we would introduce an external message broker such as RabbitMQ to facilitate messages within our systems. Instead of providing an HTTP endpoint to perform an action, the API service could subscribe to a domain event from the calling system, perform its side effect, then fire off its own domain event, to which the calling system would subscribe to. The advantage of this approach is that this scheme makes more efficient use of the network (reducing chattiness), but we trade off the advantages of using HTTP (the ubiquity of the protocol, performance enhancements like layered caching).</p>

<p>Browser-based clients can also get in on the asynchronous fun with the use of WebSockets to subscribe to server events. Instead of having a browser call an HTTP API, the browser could simply fire a WebSocket event, to which the service would asynchronously process (potentially also proxying the message downstream to other APIs with messages) and then responding via a WebSocket message when the data is done processing.</p>

<h2 id="big-challenge-data-consistency">Big challenge: data consistency</h2>

<p>When we choose an asynchronous evented approach, we now have to consider how to model asynchronous transactions. Imagine that one domain process charges a user’s credit card with a third party payment processor and another domain process is responsible for updating it in your database. There are now two processes updating two data stores. A central tenet in distributed systems design is to anticipate and expect failure. Let’s imagine any of the following scenarios happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Amazon AWS partial outage takes down one of your services but not the other.</li>
  <li>One of your services becomes backed up due to high traffic, and no longer can service new requests in a timely manner.</li>
  <li>A new deployment has introduced a data bug in a downstream API that your teams are rushing to fix, but will requiring manual reconciling with the data in the upstream system.</li>
</ol>

<p>How will you build your domain and data models to account for failures in each processing step? What would happen if you have one operation occur in one domain that depends on data that has not yet appeared in another part of the system? Can you design your data models (and database schema) to support independent updates without any dependencies? How will you handle the case when one domain action fails and the other completes?</p>

<h3 id="first-approach-avoid-it-by-choosing-noncritical-paths-to-decouple-first">First approach: avoid it by choosing noncritical paths to decouple, first</h3>

<p>If you are implementing an asynchronous, evented paradigm for the first time, I suggest you carefully begin decoupling boundaries with domain events only for events that lie outside the critical business domain path. Begin with some noncritical aspect of the system — for example, you may have a third party analytics tracking service that you must publish certain business events to. That would be a nice candidate to decouple from the main request process and move to an async path.</p>

<h3 id="second-approach-enforce-transactional-consistency-within-the-same-processdomain-boundary">Second approach: enforce transactional consistency within the same process/domain boundary</h3>

<p>Although we won’t discuss specifics in this article, if you must enforce transactional consistency in some part of your system (say, the charging of a credit card with the crediting of money to a user’s account) then I suggest that you perform those operations within the same bounded context and same process, leaning on transactional consistency guarantees provided by your database layer.</p>

<h3 id="third-approach-embrace-it-with-eventual-consistency">Third approach: embrace it with eventual consistency</h3>

<p>Alternatively, you may be able to lean on “eventual consistency” semantics with your data. Maybe it’s less important that your data squares away with itself immediately — maybe it’s more important that the data, at some guaranteed point in time — eventually lines up. It may be OK for some aspect of your data (e.g. notifications in a news feed) and may not be appropriate for other data (e.g. a bank account balance).</p>

<p>You may need to fortify your system to ensure that data eventually becomes consistent. This may involve building out the following pieces of infrastructure.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Messages need to be durable — make sure your job enqueuing system does not drop messages, or at least has a failure mode to re-process them when (not if!) your system fails.</li>
  <li>Your jobs should be designed to be idempotent, so they can be retried multiple times and result in the correct outcome.</li>
  <li>You should easily be able to recover from bad data scenarios. Should a service go down, it should be able to replay messages, logs, or the consumer should have a queue of retry-able messages it can send.</li>
  <li>Eventual consistency means that you may need an external process to verify consistency. You may be doing this sort of verification process in a data warehouse, or in a different software system that has a full view of all the data in your distributed system. Be sure that this sort of verification is able to reveal to you holes in the data, and provide actionable insights so you can fix them.</li>
  <li>You will need to add monitoring and logging to measure the failure modes of the system. When errors spike, or messages fail to send (events fail to fire), you need to be alerted. Once alerted, your logging must be good enough to be able to trace the source and the data that each request is firing.</li>
</ol>

<p>The scale of this subject is large and is under active research in the field of computer science. A good book to pick up that discusses this topic is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Rails-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321659368">Service-Oriented Design with Ruby on Rails</a>. The popular <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a> book also has a great topic on consistency (and is accompanied by a very helpful <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/conversation/EnsuringConsistencyIntro.html">online guide</a> as well).</p>

		<time>14 October 2016</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The first question you may be asking is - <em>why would I want to go from Rails to Java</em>?</p>

<p>Maybe you don’t have a choice. Maybe you started a new job. Maybe you heard Java was the new, old hotness. In any case, you’re a Ruby on Rails developer and you’re staring Java in the face.</p>

<h3 id="the-languages">The languages</h3>

<p>First off, Rails and Java share similar philosophies.</p>

<p>You may argue that Java is the One True Language for old-fashioned Object-Oriented Programming. The existence of strong types lead to powerful expressions around OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and the like.</p>

<p>Java and Ruby share similar philosophies - in that Everything Is An Object. In Ruby, the <code>nil</code> value is modeled as a <code>NilClass</code>. In Java, objects abound everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="the-frameworks">The frameworks</h3>

<p>I can’t speak from firsthand experience, but Java developers will tell you that developing Java apps in the early 2000s was like configuration soup. Everything was explicit and configured in XML.</p>

<p>Spring Boot arguable moves the state of the art in Java frameworks more towards’ Rails’ philosophies - that convention trumps configuration. It accomplishes this through <em>annotations</em> - more on this later.</p>

<p>Rails was precisely so groundbreaking and exciting in 2005 because it was everything Java was not - terse, expressive, and unapologetically convention-driven. Where in Java, everything was explicitly traceable through system calls, Rails used magic methods of dynamically-defined methods, monkey-patching and big ol’ global God Objects to accomplish its magic.</p>

<h3 id="liquibase-vs-active-record">Liquibase vs Active Record</h3>

<p>In Active Record, database changes are called <em>migrations</em>.</p>

<p>Migrations are only run from migration files, and may optionally be generated from the CLI.</p>

<p>In Liquibase, these are called <em>changesets</em>, and the files are called <em>changelogs</em>.</p>

<p>These migrations are either generated from the Liquibase CLI, or there is a nifty tool that reads Hibernate persistence entities and generates a “diff” against a known database, writing the migration to a file.</p>

<p>Rails checks in a <code>schema.rb</code> file, encompassing the canonical definition of the DB schema. There is no such equivalent in Liquibase (* I may be wrong).</p>

<p><strong>To be continued…</strong></p>

		<time>24 June 2016</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>You’ve resolved to build your company’s Next Big Thing in Phoenix and Elixir. That’s great! You’re facing a problem though - all user authentication and access concerns are performed on your Rails system, and the work to reimplement this in Phoenix is significant.</p>

<p>Fortunately for you, there is a great Phoenix plug to share session data between Rails and Phoenix. If you pull this off, you’ll be able to build your new API on your Phoenix app, all while letting Rails handle user authentication and session management.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h3>
<p>In this scenario, you want to build out a new API in Phoenix that is consumed by your frontend single-page application, whose sessions are hosted on Rails. We’ll call the Rails app <code>rails_app</code> and your new Phoenix app <code>phoenix_app</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, each app will use a different subdomain. The Rails app will be deployed at the <code>www.myapp.com</code> subdomain. The Phoenix app will be deployed at the <code>api.myapp.com</code> subdomain.</p>

<p>We are going to take <a href="https://github.com/cconstantin">Chris Constantin</a>’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/cconstantin/plug_rails_cookie_session_store"><code>PlugRailsCookieSessionStore</code></a> plug and integrate it into our Phoenix project. Both apps will be configured with identical cookie domains, encryption salts, signing salts, and security tokens.</p>

<p>In the examples that follow, I’ll be using the latest versions of each framework at the time of writing, Rails 4.2 and Phoenix 1.2.</p>

<h3 id="cookie-based-session-storage">Cookie-based session storage</h3>

<p>Our session data is stored on the client in a secure, encrypted, validated cookie. We won’t cover the basics of cookies here, but <a href="http://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-rails-sessions-work/">you can read more about them here</a>.</p>

<p>Our approach will only work if your current Rails system utilizes cookie-based sessions. We will not cover the use case with a database-backed session store in SQL, Redis, or Memcache.</p>

<h4 id="configure-the-cookie-store">Configure the cookie store</h4>

<p>Let’s set up your Rails app to use a JSON cookie storage format:</p>

<p>Your app may not be configured with a <code>SESSION_ENCRYPTED_COOKIE_SALT</code> and <code>SESSION_ENCRYPTED_SIGNED_COOKIE_SALT</code>. You may generate a pair with any random values.</p>

<p><a href="http://nipperlabs.com/rails-secretkeybase">Some speculate</a> that Rails does not require the two salts by default because the <code>SECRET_KEY_BASE</code> is sufficiently long enough to not require a salt. In our example, we choose to supply them anyways to be explicit.</p>

<p>Another important value to note here is that we have chosen a key for our session cookie - <code>_rails_app_session</code>. This value will be the shared cookie key for both apps.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-configure-the-plug-for-phoenix">Step 2: Configure the plug for Phoenix</h3>

<p>Turning our attention to our Phoenix app, in the <code>mix.exs</code> file, add the library dependency:</p>

<p>Then run <code>mix deps.get</code> to fetch the new library.</p>

<p>Now in your <code>web/phoenix_app/endpoint.ex</code> file, remove the configuration for the existing session store and add the configuration for the Rails session store.</p>

<p>We set a <code>DOMAIN</code> environment variable with the value<br />
<code>myapp.com</code>. The goal is for these two apps to be able to be deployed at any subdomain that ends in <code>myapp.com</code>, and still be able to share the cookie.</p>

<p>The <code>secure</code> flag configures the app to send a secure cookie, which only is served over SSL HTTPS connections. It is highly recommended for your site; if you haven’t upgraded to SSL, you should do so now!</p>

<p>Our cookies are signed such that their origins are guaranteed to have been computed from our app(s). This is done for free with Rails (and Phoenix’s) session libraries. The signature is derived from the <code>secret_key_base</code> and <code>signing_salt</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>encrypt</code> flag encrypts the contents of the cookie’s value with an encryption key derived from <code>secret_key_base</code> and <code>encryption_salt</code>. This should always be set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><code>key_iterations</code>, <code>key_length</code> and <code>key_digest</code> are configurations that dictate how the signing and encryption keys are derived. These are <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/application.rb">configured to match Rails’ defaults</a> (see also: <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/key_generator.rb">defaults</a>). Unless your Rails app has custom configurations for these values, you should leave them be.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-configure-both-apps-to-read-from-the-new-environment-variables">Step 3: Configure both apps to read from the new environment variables</h3>

<p>Be sure your development and production versions of your app are configured with identical values for <code>DOMAIN</code>, <code>SESSION_ENCRYPTED_COOKIE_SALT</code> and <code>SESSION_ENCRYPTED_SIGNED_COOKIE_SALT</code>. You’ll want to make sure your production apps store identical key-value pairs.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-change-phoenix-controllers-to-verify-sessions-based-on-session-data">Step 4: Change Phoenix controllers to verify sessions based on session data.</h3>

<p>Now when the Phoenix app receives incoming requests, it can simply look up user session data in the session cookie to determine whether the user is logged in, and who that user is.</p>

<p>In this example, our Rails app implements user auth with Devise and Warden. We know that Warden stores the user ID and a segment of the password hash in the <code>warden.user.user.key</code> session variable.</p>

<p>Here’s what the raw session data looks like when the <code>PlugRailsCookieSessionStore</code> extracts it from the cookie:</p>

<p>Let’s enhance our <code>Session</code> module with the capability to fetch additional information from another resource.</p>

<p>In this case, we’ll model a call an external User API to fetch extended data about the User, potentially with some sensitive information (that’s why we didn’t want to serialize it into the session).</p>

<h3 id="caveats-and-considerations">Caveats and considerations</h3>

<h4 id="csrf-incompatibilites">CSRF incompatibilites</h4>

<p>At the time of this writing, Phoenix and Rails overwrite each others’ session CSRF tokens with incompatible token schemes. This means that you are not able to make remote POST or PUT requests across the apps with CSRF protection turned on. Our current approach will work best with a read-only API, at the moment.</p>

<h4 id="be-judicious-about-what-you-store-in-a-cookie">Be judicious about what you store in a cookie</h4>

<p>Cookies themselves have their own strengths and drawbacks. We should note that you should be judicious about the amount of <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#replay-attacks-for-cookiestore-sessions">data you store in a session</a> (hint: only the bare minimum, and nothing sensitive).</p>

<p>The OWASP guidelines also provide some <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet">general security practices around cookie session storage</a>.</p>

<h4 id="moving-beyond-session-sharing">Moving beyond session sharing</h4>

<p>Even though this scheme may work in the short run, coupling our apps at this level in the long run will result in headaches as the apps are coupled to intricate session implementation details. If, in the long run, you wanted to continue scaling out your Phoenix app ecosystem, you may want to look into the following authentication patterns, both of which move your system toward a microservices architecture.</p>

<p>1) Develop an <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a> whose purpose is to be the browser’s buffer to your internal service architecture. This one gateway is responsible for identity access and control, decrypting session data and proxying requests to an umbrella of internal services (which may be Rails or Phoenix). Internal services may receive user identities in unencrypted form.</p>

<p>2) Consider implementing a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT token implementation</a> across your apps, in which <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/">all session and authorization claims are stored in the token itself, and encrypted in the client and server.</a>. This scheme may still rely on cookies (you may store the token in a cookie, or pass it around in an HTTP header). The benefits of this scheme is the ability for your app(s) to manage identity and authentication claims on their own without having to verify against a third party. Drawbacks of this scheme are <a href="http://blog.prevoty.com/does-jwt-put-your-web-app-at-risk">the difficulty around revoking or expiring sessions</a>.</p>

<p>Each of these approaches is not without overhead and complexity; be sure to do your homework before your proceed.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>That’s it! I hope I’ve illustrated a quick and easy way to get a working Phoenix app sharing sessions with Rails app(s), should you decide to prototype one in your existing system. I’ve also pushed up a <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/sample-rails-phoenix-shared-sessions/">sample app if you want to cross-reference the code</a>. Good luck!</p>
