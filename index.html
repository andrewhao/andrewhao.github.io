  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to discuss a topic near and dear to my heart, and what I believe
is at the crux of effective software design. It&rsquo;s not a new functional language,
it&rsquo;s not a fancy new framework, a how-to guide to do microservices, nor a quantum leap in the field of machine learning.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s much simpler.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about names.</p>

<p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rL73HKlqbH0/TKhVHMbs2oI/AAAAAAAABEc/DiPbblM0R44/s1600/sistine-chapel-michelangelo-paintings-6.jpg" alt="In the beginning..." /></p>

<p><em>Names define us</em>. They define concepts. They imbue a concept with shared understanding. They&rsquo;re language concepts, but more than that, they&rsquo;re units of meaning.</p>

<p>Software development is a fundamentally human endeavour. No amount of technical computing breakthroughs will change the fact that software development is still the arduous task of getting a team together full of humans from a kaleidescope of different cultural, linguistic backgrounds &ndash; then throwing them together to build an arbitrarily complex product in a rapidly-shifting competitive landscape.</p>

<p>Not only that, the thing to build is chock-full of systems that interact with other systems of unbounded complexity. Additionally, once your software system is out in the wild, you need to make sure that it was the right thing to build. Is the product you built correctly tuned to your market? Is it generating sufficient revenue?</p>

<p>The landscape is littered with software projects that began ambitiously, but got lost in a towering mess of fragile code. It&rsquo;s no wonder that developing reliable, successful software is more art than science.</p>

<h3>Crossing our linguistic wires</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s rewind back to a scene from a typical day in the life of your software development team. Think back to the last time you discussed a story with your product owner, how did it unfold?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a scene at Delorean, the Uber for time travel, where you work:</p>

<blockquote><p>PO: Our next big project is to update our driver app to show rider locations on the timeline map.</p>

<p>You: And when do these riders show up on the timeline map?</p>

<p>PO: When the driver turns on the app and signals that she&rsquo;s driving.</p>

<p>You: OK, so that means when the app boots up and the DriverStatus service receives a POST we&rsquo;ll need to simultaneously fetch references from the HailingUser service based on time locality.</p>

<p>PO: Um&hellip; I guess so?</p></blockquote>

<p>Or how about your last iteration planning meeting, where you discussed the intricacies of a specific story?</p>

<blockquote><p>PO: In this story, we&rsquo;re going to add a coupon box to the checkout flow.</p>

<p>You: [Thinking out loud] Hm&hellip; would that mean we add a <code>/coupon</code> route to the checkout API?</p>

<p>Teammate: Wait &ndash; I think we call them <code>Discounts</code> in the backend. And the checkout flow is technically part of the <code>RideCommerce</code> service.</p>

<p>You: Right &ndash; I mean let&rsquo;s call the route <code>/coupon</code> but it&rsquo;ll create a <code>Discount</code> object. And in this story,    let&rsquo;s just remember that the checkout API really refers to the <code>RideCommerce</code> service.</p>

<p>PO: I&rsquo;ll add a note to the story.</p></blockquote>

<p>The implementing engineer, of course, doesn&rsquo;t read the note in the story (who has time to, anyways?). In the course of implementation, he gets tripped up in semantics and spends the better part of a half day re-implementing the <code>Checkout</code> flow as an entirely new service, before realizing his mistake in code review and backing out his changes.</p>

<p>Months later, a new colleague is tasked to fix the link in the checkout flow, but files an incomplete fix because she was not aware of the fact that <code>Coupons</code> actually had mappings back to <code>Discounts</code>. The bug makes its way to production, where it subtly lies dormant until a most inopportune time&hellip;</p>

<h3>A better, Domain-Driven way</h3>

<p>In Eric Evans&#8217; book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215"><strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong></a>, he describes the concept of a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">Ubiquitous Language</a> &ndash; a shared, common vocabulary that the entire team shares when discussing software.</p>

<p>When we say the &ldquo;entire team&rdquo;, we mean the combined team of designers, developers, the product owner and any other domain experts that might be at hand.</p>

<p>Your product owner may be your domain expert (and typically is). However, you may have other domain experts such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any team that builds reporting or analytics off of your software.</li>
<li>Upstream data providers</li>
<li>Anybody further up the reporting chain whose purview includes the software you&rsquo;re building, or its effects. Think: the Director of Finance, the COO, the head of Customer Support.</li>
<li>The users of your software</li>
</ul>


<p>Side note: in XP, each team has an &ldquo;onsite customer&rdquo; &ndash; this is your domain expert!</p>

<h4>Developing a Ubiquitous Language with a Glossary</h4>

<p>Try this: keep a living document of all the terminology your team uses &ndash; along with all its definitions. This <strong>Glossary</strong> is exactly what it sounds &ndash; a list of terms and their definitions.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Delorean Team Glossary
</span><span class='line'>----------------------
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>- **Coupon**: an applied discount to a BookingAmount. A coupon may take the form of a Fixed or a Percentage amount.
</span><span class='line'>   - **Fixed-type**: A coupon that applies a fixed amount of money - e.g. a $30 USD discount.
</span><span class='line'>   - **Percentage-type**: A coupon that applies a percentage savings off the total BookingAmount.
</span><span class='line'>- **Driver**: An employed driver who drives within the system, picking up passengers and driving Trips for payment.
</span><span class='line'>- **Trip**: An itinerary of passenger pick-up and drop-off location and times.
</span><span class='line'>- **Rider**: The passenger that books the trip and is transported by the *Driver*.
</span><span class='line'>- **Booking**: A reservation for a Trip, as booked by the *Rider*.
</span><span class='line'>- **BookingAmount**: The monetary amount of the Trip, accounting for the trip cost, surge pricing, coupons and taxes.
</span><span class='line'>- **Routing Engine:** The software system that maps out the driving directions for a driver.
</span><span class='line'>- **Payment**: A record of how a user paid.
</span><span class='line'>- **Charge**: A financial transaction for a specific dollar amount, for a specific charge method to an institution.
</span><span class='line'>- **Checkout**: A workflow in which a *Payment* is made for a *Booking*.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From now on, use only the term definitions listed here in your stories. Be explicit about how you use your language!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on many projects where the sloppy usage of a term from project inception led to the usage of that term in the code &ndash; codifying that messy, slippery term throughout the life of the project!</p>

<p>Which leads us to our next point:</p>

<h4>Refactoring your team to use the right terms</h4>

<p>Your <strong>Glossary</strong> is a living document. It is meant to be living &ndash; either on a continually-updated Google Doc or a wiki page. It should be visible for all to see &ndash; you should print it out and post it on the walls!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a planning meeting:</p>

<blockquote><p>You: So when a user logs into the app and broadcasts that they&rsquo;re ready to drive&hellip;</p>

<p>PO: You mean <em>Driver</em>. When a <em>Driver</em> logs in.</p>

<p>You: Right. Good catch.</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems a little silly (after all, you both know only Drivers use the broadcast feature of the app), but the laser focus on using the right words means that your team is always on the same page when talking about things.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, your teammate taps you on the shoulder:</p>

<blockquote><p>Teammate: I&rsquo;m about to implement the Coupon story. I suggest we rename the <code>Discount</code> class to <code>Coupon</code>.</p>

<p>You: Great idea. That way, we aren&rsquo;t tripped up by the naming mismatches in the future.</p>

<p>Teammate: I do have a question about the coupon, though. Do you think it&rsquo;s <em>applied</em> to the <strong>BookingAmount</strong>, or is it <em>added</em>?</p>

<p>PO: [Overhearing conversation] You had it right. It&rsquo;s <em>applied</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You and your teammate then go and update the glossary, scribbling an addendum on the wall (or updating your wiki):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- **Coupon**: ... Coupons may be *applied* to BookingAmounts to discount the total cost of the booking.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Refactoring your code to use the right terms</h4>

<p>Your teammate and you then walk over to her desk; as a pair you proceed to refactor the existing account code. We&rsquo;ll use Ruby for the sake of this example.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the code looks like this:</p>

<p>You take a first pass and rename the <code>Discount</code> class to <code>Coupon</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s something funny here &ndash; your domain language suggests that a <strong>Coupon</strong> is <em>applied to</em> a <strong>BookingAmount</strong>. You pause, because the code reads the opposite &ndash; &ldquo;A Coupon calculates its amount for a BookingAmount&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p>You: How about we also refactor the <code>calculate_amount_for</code> method to reflect the language a little better?</p>

<p>Teammate: Yeah. It sounds like the action occurs the other way &ndash; the BookingAmount is responsible for applying a Coupon to itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>In your next refactoring pass, you move the <code>calculate_amount_for</code> method into the <code>BookingAmount</code>, calling it <code>applied_discount_total</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, you change your <code>Checkout</code> implementation to match:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Checkout</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you read the implementation in plain English, it reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>The checkout&rsquo;s total amount is calculated by subtracting the booking amount&rsquo;s applied coupon amount from the booking amount price.</p></blockquote>

<p>Phew! Designing a strong <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> was hard work! In fact, you had spent a goodly amount of time debating and clarifying with your domain experts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a Coupon <em>applied</em> to a BookingAmount, or is it <em>discounted from</em> one?</li>
<li>Should we call it a Coupon <em>amount</em>, or a Coupon <em>cost</em>?</li>
<li>Is the pre-tax, pre-discount amount in the BookingAmount called a <em>price</em>, or a <em>cost</em>?</li>
</ul>


<p>Whatever you agreed on, that&rsquo;s what you changed your code to reflect.</p>

<h4>Continual refinement</h4>

<p>Hm. Something still feels off.</p>

<p>You and your teammate feel your OOP spidey senses going haywire.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teammate: Hm. I guess that worked, but that&rsquo;s still not exactly as clean as we wanted it. Isn&rsquo;t it kind of weird how the Checkout owns the calculation for the calculation of a discount?</p>

<p>You: Yeah, I see where you&rsquo;re coming from. That&rsquo;s just not good OO design. Additionally, if we notice the language our domain experts were using, they didn&rsquo;t mention that the checkout total was some subtraction of something from another thing. The Checkout&rsquo;s total simply is the order amount, after application of a Coupon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your partner and you take one last step:</p>

<p>You sit back and read it back, out loud:</p>

<blockquote><p>The checkout&rsquo;s total amount is the BookingAmount after a Coupon has been applied.</p></blockquote>

<p>You both smile. Much better.</p>

<h3>In closing&hellip;</h3>

<p>In this brief time we had together,</p>

<ul>
<li>We discussed why names are important &ndash; especially in a complex endeavour like software development.</li>
<li>We covered why it&rsquo;s important to arrive at a shared understanding, together as a team, using the same words and vocabulary.</li>
<li>We discovered how to build and integrate a <strong>Glossary</strong> into the daily rhythm of our team</li>
<li>We refactored the code twice &ndash; illustrating how to get code in line with the domain language.</li>
</ul>


<h3>And there is much more!</h3>

<p>In an upcoming post, we&rsquo;ll investigate how the <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> applies to a core concept of Domain-Driven Design: the <strong>Bounded Context</strong>. Why is that important? Because Bounded Contexts give us tools to organize our code &ndash; and to do further advanced things like <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/andrewhao/ddd-rail-your-monorail">break up monoliths into services</a>. More on that to come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much of RxJS involves working with
<a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/backpressure.html">backpressure</a> &ndash; how to reconcile
streams that emit/process data at different rates, without overloading
the system. Much of that model is built with lossy handling in mind &ndash; it
makes sense that when your system is under duress, that you design your
streams to degrade gracefully (e.g. drop certain events, or rate limit
them by chunking into windows, etc).</p>

<p>However, there are times when it is appropriate to have a lossless
approach to backpressure &ndash; e.g., to store every chunk of data that comes
through a stream in memory, and not drop things. These use cases may
come about when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a short-lived, or bounded set of data you know will come over
the pipe. You understand the bounds of the data that will ever come over
the pipe.</li>
<li>You have a processing script you want to run, which is not part of a
large system.</li>
<li>You have a honkin&#8217; large system that can handle the load.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my case, I had a script that called the Google Geocoding API for a
set of GPS coordinates. Now for a set of several hundred coordinates, I
would end up calling the API several hundred times all at once with this
naive implementation:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I searched all over for a lossless throttling mechanism, but all I could
find was references to RxJS&rsquo;s lossy <a href="">throttle</a> behavior.</p>

<p>Other frameworks, like <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/#observable-bufferingthrottle">Bacon.js&rsquo;s bufferingThrottle()</a> and <a href="http://highlandjs.org/#ratelimit">Highland.js ratelimit()</a> seemed attractive. Where was RxJS&rsquo;s equivalent?</p>

<p>Thanks to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34955842/rate-limiting-http-calls-made-by-rxjs">helpful StackOverflow post</a>,
I found the answer: the use of
<a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/concatmap.md">concatMap()</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/delay.md">delay()</a>
forces the incoming stream to execute serially over artificial time delayed streams.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the confusing aspects about working with streams is diving into
Rx operators that take a stream and fan out into multiple streams.</p>

<p>Is your head exploding yet?</p>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into a problem I ran into while working on a personal
project:</p>

<p>The task at hand is to take a list of GPS moving point data and
partition the group data into multiple clusters of points, count up each
group, then return the aggregate stats. As a cyclist is moving, I want
to know how often they are moving at that specific velocity (speed).</p>

<p>Our weapon of choice is the <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/groupby.html">RxJS groupBy() function</a>,
which groups like stream values based on a key value you define.</p>

<p><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/groupby.html"><img src="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/images/groupBy.c.png" alt="Image of groupBy() at work, with marbles." /></a></p>

<p>OK. Easy enough. So my implementation looked something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">gpsPointStream</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">groupBy</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">velocity</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The supplied <code>(point) =&gt; point.velocity</code> function determines the <code>key</code>
value for the supplied event, which then 1) creates a new Observable
sequence for that specific <code>key</code> value, if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, or 2)
assigns your event to an existing Observable sequence.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Never fear, <code>flatMap()</code> to the rescue.</h2>

<p>So the story turns to our hero
<a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html"><code>flatMap()</code></a>, which as it turns out is
specifically tuned to deal with issues of dealing with multiple streams.</p>

<p><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html"><img src="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/images/flatMap.c.png" alt="Marble diagram for flatMap" /></a></p>

<p><code>flatMap</code> will take a supplied function as its argument, which is the
operation to apply to each argument within the supplied stream.</p>

<p>What just happened here?</p>

<p>I specified a merging function for the <code>flatMap()</code> stream, which
performed the <code>scan()</code> counting aggregation on my group before merging the
stream back into the main stream. I threw in a <code>zip</code>, which annotated my
aggregate count value with a record of the group key (velocity) that
this value was computed for.</p>

<h2>Compare it to imperative</h2>

<p>The equivalent of <code>groupBy</code>/<code>flatMap</code> in imperative programming is, quite
literally, just <code>_.groupBy()</code> and <code>_.flatMap()</code>. With a few key
differences. Here it is in <a href="https://lodash.com/docs#groupBy">lodash</a>:</p>

<p>So in the end, the end result was the same with one crucial difference &ndash;
our Observable, reactive version was able to take intermediate accounts
into time and perform an intermediate calculation as data was flowing
in. This allowed us to generate an intermediate count for the &ldquo;0&rdquo; velocity
group.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you want to fan out a stream into groups or partitions based on a
specific stream value, turn to
<a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/groupby.md"><code>groupBy</code></a>.</li>
<li>When you have a need to combine a stream-of-streams, you want to look at
<a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/selectmany.md"><code>flatMap</code></a>. You may also consider looking at <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/concatmap.md"><code>concatMap</code></a>, a close cousin of <code>flatMap</code>.</li>
<li>Reactive programming gives you more expressive abilities to reason
about time and event ordering. You just have to tilt your head a little
bit.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Going to Strange Loop was a huge check off my conference bucket list
(lanyard?). I&rsquo;d always heard about this slightly-weird, highly academic
collision between academia and industry, skewing toward programming
languages you haven&rsquo;t heard of (or, at the very least, you&rsquo;ve never used
in production). I anticipated sitting at the feet of gray-haired wizards
and bright-eyed hipsters with Ph.Ds.</p>

<p>The conference did not disappoint. And it was not quite what I
expected-I less sat at the feet of geniuses than I did talk with them,
peer-to-peer, about topics of interest. All around me people were saying
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions. Don&rsquo;t feel stupid &ndash; nobody knows
everything.&rdquo; Speakers were tweeting about how much they were learning.
It was comforting, because lots of topics I had come to see were those
in which I had no. freakin. clue. about.</p>

<p>The following is culled from my notes from different sessions I
attended. I will focus on brevity. I will keep it clear. Here we go:</p>

<h3>Opening Keynote: &ldquo;I see what you mean&rdquo; &ndash; Peter Alvaro</h3>

<ul>
<li>Instructions, behaviors &amp; outcomes.</li>
<li>It &ldquo;feels good&rdquo; to write in C (a hardcore 1000 liner)</li>
<li>But a declarative program (e.g. SQL) works well, but is harder to come
up with.</li>
<li>The declarative world &ndash; as described in the work done in Datalog</li>
<li>How can we take concepts from Datalog and apply to real-world
resources like network actors (distributed systems)?</li>
<li>It becomes easier to model these systems declaratively when we
explicitly capture time.</li>
<li>Enter Dedalus: extension to Datalog where time is a modeling
construct.</li>
<li>(Show off usage of <code>@next</code> and <code>@async</code> annotations</li>
<li>Computation is redezvous &ndash; the only thing that you know is what YOU
know at that point in time.</li>
<li>Takeaway: Abstractions leak. Model them better (e.g. with time)</li>
<li>Inventing languages is dope.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Take concept of Lamport clocks and extend them with hybrid clocks.</li>
<li>And extend them one further with: Distributed Monotonic Clocks</li>
<li>These DMCs use population protocol (flocking) to each actor in the
system communicate with another, updating their source of truth to
eventually agree on a media time w/in the group</li>
<li>DMC components:

<ol>
<li>Have a reset button by adding epoch bit</li>
<li>Use flocking (via population protocol) to avoid resets</li>
<li>Accomodates for some clockless nodes</li>
<li>Explicitly reflects causality</li>

<ul>
<li>Designing for worst case often penalizes average case</li>
<li>But what if designing for the worst case actually helps avg case?</li>
<li>Examples from dstbd systems:

<ul>
<li>Worst case of disconnected data centers, packet loss/link loss. Fix
by introducing coordination-free protocols. Boom, you&rsquo;ve now made your
network more scalable, performant, resistent to downtime.</li>
<li>Worst case: hard to coordinate a distributed transaction between
services. What do you do? You implement something like buffered writes
out of process.

<ul>
<li>CRDT, RAMP, HAT, bloom</li>
<li>Suddenly, you have fault tolerance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tail latency problem in microservices: the more microservices you
query, the higher the probability of hitting a slow server response.

<ul>
<li>Your service&rsquo;s corner case is your user&rsquo;s average case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HCI: accessibility guidelines in W3C lift standards for all. Make
webpages easier to navigate. Side effect of better page performance,
higher conversion.</li>
<li>Netflix designing CC subtitles also benefits other users.</li>
<li>Curb cuts in the real world to help ADA/mobility-assisted folks also
benefit normal folks too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Best has pitfalls too: your notion of best may be hard to hit, or
risky. You may want to optimize for &ldquo;stable&rdquo; solution. (Robust
optimization)</li>
<li>When to design for worst case?

<ul>
<li>common corner cases</li>
<li>environmental conditions vary</li>
<li>&ldquo;normal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t normal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>worst forces a conversation

<ul>
<li>how do we plan for failures?</li>
<li>what is our scale-out strategy?</li>
<li>how do we audit failures? data breaches?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ideology by Gary Bernardt</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rumsfeld: known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.</li>
<li>Ideology is the thing you know you do not know you know</li>
<li>Conflict between typed vs dynamic programmers:

<ul>
<li>Typed: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need tests, I have types&rdquo;</li>
<li>Dynamic: &ldquo;I write tests, so I don&rsquo;t need types&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In reality, they are solving different places in the problem domain,
but they have different beliefs about the world that are hidden in the
shadows:

<ul>
<li>Typed: &ldquo;Correctness comes solely from types&rdquo;</li>
<li>Dynamic: &ldquo;Correctness comes solely from example&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;I need nulls&rdquo; &ndash;> You believe nulls are the only way to represent absence</li>
<li>&ldquo;Immutable data structures are slow&rdquo; &ndash;> You believe all immutable types are slow</li>
<li>&ldquo;GC is impractical&rdquo; &ndash;> you believe GC algorithms won&rsquo;t get faster.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago, I was tuning a Rails app for one of our clients.
This client wanted to know how performant their app would be under load.</p>

<p>To do that, you can do several different things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tune the thread/process balance within the VM</li>
<li>Horizontally scale with your cloud platform.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a discussion of the former (#1):</p>

<h2>1) Set up the test</h2>

<h3>Drive with a synthetic script</h3>

<p>Our application had a synthetic load driver that would run Selenium to
execute various app tasks. This synthetic driver could be parallelized
across many notes via Rainforest QA, Sauce Labs or Browserify.</p>

<p>In our case, I only needed to run our synthetic load script on a single
node in multiple processes, which simulated enough load to anticipate
another order of magnitude of traffic.</p>

<h3>Know how to inspect the server under load.</h3>

<p>Commands you will want to know:</p>

<pre><code>$ free -m # Find the total amount of free memory on your machine
$ ps uH p &lt;pid&gt; # List out process threads
$ kill -TTIN &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Add a puma worker
$ kill -TTOU &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Remove a puma worker
$ kill -USR2 &lt;puma_master_pid&gt; # Kill the puma master &amp; workers
</code></pre>

<h2>Generating more load: use external load testing services, or plain tools.</h2>

<p>Try using <a href="http://www.flood.io">Flood.io</a> or JMeter for performance load.</p>

<p>I tried looking into the <a href="https://github.com/schneems/puma_auto_tune">puma_auto_tune</a> gem, but it required a higher level of production instrumentation than I was ready to give it.</p>

<h2>Analysis: New Relic scalability analysis</h2>

<p>New Relic gave us a scalability analysis scatter plot, plotting
throughput against average application response time. In essence, it
allows you to see spikes in response times as correlated to throughput.</p>

<h2>Process:</h2>

<p>My approach was to use the synthetic script to generate productionlike
node and ramp up the # of load actors in 5m increments. Each run would
test the following Puma process/thread balance:</p>

<p>Run #1: Single-process, multi threads.
Run #2: Multiple processes, single threaded.
Run #3: Multiple processes, multiple threads.</p>

<blockquote><h3>Aside: <em>how many</em> of these threads/processes should I be using?</h3>

<p>Note that your numbers will be different on the execution
characteristics of your app and your server environment. Tweak it for
yourself. You&rsquo;re designing an experiment.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, our Rails app started out with 4 threads on 2
workers. We made the # of Puma workers (both min and max) environment
variables so we could tweak the variables easily without deploying.</p></blockquote>

<p>The strategy was then to look at the perf characteristics of each run in
the scatter plot. If there were any spikes in the graph with the
increase of load, then that would be noted. Even minor features like an
increase in slope would be noted &ndash; at that point, the incremental cost
of each request increases with overall system load.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the New Relic data on hand to show, now, but in our case we
discovered two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The server easily scaled from ~10 &ndash;> ~500 rpm with a virtually flat
line for all runs.</li>
<li>The app exhibited no noticeable performance differences when flipped
between uniprocess-multithreaded, multiprocess-unithreaded, and
multiprocess-multithreaded modes. Any performance gains were under a
tolerable threshold.</li>
</ol>


<p>How do we parse these results?</p>

<ul>
<li>We note that we didn&rsquo;t really push the performance threshold on this
app (it&rsquo;s not meant to be a public web site and 95% of it is behind a
login wall to a specialized group of users). Thus, if we pushed the
concurrent connections even more, we may have seen more of a pronounced
difference.</li>
<li>The <em>absence</em> of any major red flags was itself a validation. The
question we wanted answered coming into this experiment was &ldquo;how close
are we to maxing out our single-node EC2 configuration such that we will
have to begin configuring horizontal scaling?&rdquo;? The answer was: we can
safely scale further out in the near-term future, and cross the bridge
of horizontal scaling/bursting when we get there.</li>
<li>We did not have enough statistically significant differences in
performance for #threads/#processes in Puma. However, if we wanted to
truly find the optimal performance in our app, we would have turned to
tools like <a href="https://github.com/schneems/puma_auto_tune">puma_auto_tune</a> to answer those questions.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following are some notes I&rsquo;m compiling as I&rsquo;m beginning a journey
down the rabbit hole, writing an app in Swift utilizing the <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-13/viper.html">VIPER app development methodology</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had trouble importing nested source code into XCode before realizing that I
needed to import the folder with corresponding Groups. This is done by
clicking the checkbox &ldquo;Create Groups for any Added Folders&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without doing this, the compiler was not able to build the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since there is no way to do method swizzling in Swift, there are no real easy ways to do mocking/stubbing the way we used to do so in Ruby. Instead, this is forcing me to rely on plain old Swift structs. There are some simple ways to stub, but it ends up looking kind of awkward and very wiring-intensive like this:</li>

<li>Using the <a href="https://github.com/teambox/viper-module-generator"><code>vipergen</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/team-supercharge/boa"><code>boa</code></a> scaffolding generators helped me understand the concepts behind the view.</li>
<li>Tip: Build a VIPER module, but don&rsquo;t build it all at once. Just focus on the Presenter-Interactor-Wireframe component, or the DataStore-Entity-Interactor component. This will keep your head from exploding.</li>

<li>xcodebuild + <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty">xcpretty</a> + Guard-shell == some sort of CI feedback loop.</li>
<li>Manually creating mocks in Swift = kind of painful. If you override (subclass) a NSObject in Swift, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/30530308/993929">you must provide it with the <code>@objc</code> pragma, otherwise it throws a segfault error</a></li>
<li>You must contact CircleCI manually if you want to activate an iOS build (it&rsquo;s still in beta). What are some other good CI tools to use with iOS?</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With my current fascination with <a href="http://github.com/andrewhao/stressfactor">tracking workouts and location-based-activities</a>, I have been interested in how I might be able to rewrite some of my stats logic with FRP principles.</p>

<h3>What is FRP?</h3>

<p>FRP, or Functional Reactive Programming, is often defined as &ldquo;functional programming over values that change over time&rdquo;. It uses functional composition for streams of data that may appear in an infinite stream of data for some far indeterminate future &ndash; these types of use cases are served well by FRP which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">&ldquo;(simplifies) these problems by explicitly modeling time&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h3>GPS &ndash; your location, varied over time.</h3>

<p>A great application of this would be a workout. Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to build an app that received realtime updates on a person&rsquo;s position. Say the app was a Node server that received this JSON blob from a web API as a location update:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">&#39;lat&#39;:</span> <span class="err">29.192414,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;lon&#39;:</span> <span class="err">148.113241,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;ele&#39;:</span> <span class="err">122.1,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;time&#39;:</span> <span class="err">&#39;2015-04-18T13:54:56Z&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Say that some time later, the API receives this JSON blob:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span> <span class="err">&#39;lat&#39;:</span> <span class="err">29.192424,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;lon&#39;:</span> <span class="err">148.113251,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;ele&#39;:</span> <span class="err">123.1,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">&#39;time&#39;:</span> <span class="err">&#39;2015-04-18T13:55:26Z&#39;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we have these data points, that the user has moved <code>+0.00001</code> latitude points and <code>+0.00001</code> longitude points, climbing a total of <code>+1.0</code> meters, over a period of <code>30</code> seconds.</p>

<h4>Exercise: Get my instantaneous velocity</h4>

<p>If we performed this imperatively, we would write it something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>There is a key difference that is not easily demonstrated here &ndash; that the former imperative example requires that all JSON arrays be materialized at once &ndash; via db query, in-memory store, etc. It doesn&rsquo;t account for change in time.</p>

<p>However, the latter functional example accounts for changing values of time as they appear over the stream &ndash; as soon as a new value shows up in the stream, the velocity is changed instantly.</p>

<h3>Some more location-based experiments: rxlocation</h3>

<p>I wrote up a library to parse various facts from a changing stream of GPS events, from instantaneous velocity, average velocity, moving/stopped status, etc.</p>

<p>I investigated different reactive frameworks, mainly <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/">RxJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/">Bacon.js</a>. My takeaways were that RxJS does everything and the kitchen sink, but I got lost trying to reconcile Node streams with RxJS cold streams. Bacon.js just seemed to work for me, out of the box. I&rsquo;m still learning, so I hope to have a better understanding of the core issues here.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>(This post <a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2015/03/17/docker-rails-docker-compose-together-in-your-development-workflow/">originally appeared</a> on the Carbon Five blog.)</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been trialing the usage of Docker and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> (previously known as <a href="http://www.fig.sh">fig</a>) on a Rails project here at Carbon Five. In the past, my personal experience with Docker had been that the promise of portable containerized apps was within reach, but the tooling and development workflow were still awkward &ndash; commands were complex, configuration and linking steps were complicated, and the overall learning curve was high.</p>

<p>My team decided to take a peek at the current landscape of Docker tools (primarily boot2docker and Docker Compose) and see how easily we could spin up a new app and integrate it into our development workflow on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;ve found my experience with Docker tools to be surprisingly pleasant; the tooling easily integrates with existing Rails development workflows with only a minor amount of performance overhead. Docker Compose offers a seamless way to build containers and orchestrate their dependencies, and helps lower the learning curve to build Dockerized applications. Read on to find out how we built ours.</p>

<h2>Introduction to docker-compose (née Fig).</h2>

<p>Docker Compose acts as a wrapper around Docker &ndash; it links your containers together and provides syntactic sugar around some complex container linking commands.</p>

<p>We liked Docker Compose for its ability to coordinate and spin up your entire application and dependencies with one command. In the past, frameworks like Vagrant were easy ways to generate a standard image for your development team to use and get started on. Docker Compose offers similar benefits of decoupling the app from the host environment, but also provides the container vehicle for the app to run in all environments &ndash; that is, the container you develop in will often be the same container that you deploy to production with.</p>

<p>Docker (with the orchestration tooling provided by Compose) provides us the ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade versions of Ruby or Node (or whatever runtime your app requires) in production with far less infrastructure coordination than normally required.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of moving parts in the deployment process. Instead of writing complex Puppet and Capistrano deployment scripts, our deployments will now center around moving images around and starting containers.</li>
<li>Simplify developer onboarding by standardizing your team on the same machine images.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this example, we will run two Docker containers &ndash; a Rails container and a MySQL container &ndash; and rely on Compose to build, link, and run them.</p>

<h2>Installing boot2docker, Docker, and Docker Compose.</h2>

<p>Docker runs in a VirtualBox VM through an image called <code>boot2docker</code>. The reason we have to use <code>boot2docker</code> and VirtualBox is because the Mac OSX filesystem is not compatible with the type of filesystem required to support Docker. Hence, we must run our Docker containers within yet another virtual machine.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Now install boot2docker and Docker Compose.</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install boot2docker docker-compose
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li>Initialize and start up boot2docker</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>boot2docker start
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li>Configure your Docker host to point to your boot2docker image.</li>
</ol>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  You&rsquo;ll need to run this for every terminal session that invokes the <code>docker</code> or <code>docker-compose</code> command &ndash; better export this line into your <code>.zshrc</code> or <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<h2>Creating a Dockerfile</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a Dockerfile for this app. This specifies the base dependencies for our Rails application. We will need:</p>

<ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s start by breaking this up line-by-line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>FROM ruby:2.2.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#from"><code>FROM</code></a> directive specifies the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ruby/"><code>library/ruby</code> base image from Docker Hub</a>, and uses the <code>2.2.0</code> tag, which corresponds to the Ruby 2.2.0 runtime.</p>

<p>From here on, we are going to be executing commands that will build on this reference image.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>RUN apt-get update -qq <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install -y build-essential nodejs npm nodejs-legacy mysql-client vim
</span><span class='line'>RUN npm install -g phantomjs
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Each <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#run"><code>RUN</code></a> command builds up the image, installing specific application dependencies and setting up the environment. Here we install our app dependencies both from <code>apt</code> and <code>npm</code>.</p>

<h3>An aside on how a Docker image is built</h3>

<p>One of the core concepts in Docker is the concept of &ldquo;layers&rdquo;. Docker runs on operating systems that support layering filesystems such as <code>aufs</code> or <code>btrfs</code>. Changes to the filesystem can be thought of as atomic operations that can be rolled forward or backwards.</p>

<p>This means that Docker can effectively store its images as snapshots of each other, much like Git commits. This also has implications as to how we can build up and cache copies of the container as we go along.</p>

<p>The Dockerfile can be thought of as a series of rolling incremental changes to a base image &ndash; each command builds on top of the line before. This allows Docker to quickly rebuild changes to the reference image by understanding which lines have changed &ndash; and not rebuild the image from scratch each time.</p>

<p>Keep these concepts in mind as we talk about speeding up your Docker build in the following section.</p>

<h3>Fast Docker builds by caching your Gemfiles</h3>

<p>The following steps install the required Ruby gems for Bundler, within your app container:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>WORKDIR /tmp
</span><span class='line'>COPY Gemfile Gemfile
</span><span class='line'>COPY Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock
</span><span class='line'>RUN bundle install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note how we sneak the gems into <code>/tmp</code>, then run the <code>bundle install</code> which downloads and installs gems into Bundler&rsquo;s <code>vendor/bundle</code> directory. This is a cache hack &ndash; whereas in the past we would have kept the <code>Gemfile</code>s in with the rest of the application directory in <code>/myapp</code>.</p>

<p>Keeping Gemfiles inline with the app would have meant that the entire <code>bundle install</code> command would have been re-run on each <code>docker-compose build</code> &mdash; without any caching &mdash; due to the constant change in the code in the <code>/myapp</code> directory.</p>

<p>By separating out the Gemfiles into their own directory, we logically separate the Gemfiles, which are far less likely to change, from the app code, which are far more likely to change. This reduces the number of times we have to wait for a clean <code>bundle install</code> to complete.</p>

<p>HT: <a href="http://ilikestuffblog.com/2014/01/06/how-to-skip-bundle-install-when-deploying-a-rails-app-to-docker/">Brian Morearty: &ldquo;How to skip bundle install when deploying a Rails app to Docker&rdquo;</a></p>

<h3>Adding the app</h3>

<p>Finally, we finish our Dockerfile by adding our current app code to the working directory.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ADD . /myapp
</span><span class='line'>WORKDIR /myapp
</span><span class='line'>RUN <span class="nv">RAILS_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>production bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rake assets:precompile --trace
</span><span class='line'>CMD <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;rails&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;server&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;-b&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This links the contents of the app directory on the host to the  <code>/myapp</code> directory within the container.</p>

<p>Note that we precompile all our assets before the container boots up &ndash; this ensures that the container is preloaded and ready to run and jives with Docker tenets that a container should be the same container that runs in development, test, and production environments.</p>

<h2>Setting up Docker Compose</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve defined a <code>Dockerfile</code> for booting our Rails app, we turn to the Compose piece that orchestrates the linking phase between the Rails app and its dependencies &ndash; in this case, the DB.</p>

<p>A <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file automatically configures our application ecosystem. Here, it defines our Rails container and its db container:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&#39;.env.db&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>

<p>will spin up both the <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> instances.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful tools of using Docker Compose is the ability to abstract away the configuration of your server, no matter whether it is running as a development container on your computer, a test container on CI, or on your production Docker host.</p>

<p>The directive:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">links</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will add an entry for <code>db</code> into the Rails&#8217; container&rsquo;s <code>/etc/hosts</code>, linking the hostname to the correct container. This allows us to write our database.yml like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># config/database.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">development</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="nl">&amp;default</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">host</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">db</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another important thing to note is the <code>volumes</code> configuration:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># docker-compose.yml</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">volumes</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">.:/myapp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This mounts the current directory <code>.</code> on the host Mac to the <code>/myapp</code> directory in the container. This allows us to make live code changes on the host filesystem and see code changes reflected in the container.</p>

<p>Also note that we make use of Compose&rsquo;s <code>env_file</code> directive, which allows us to specify environment variables to inject into the container at runtime:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">env_file</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&#39;.env.web&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> A peek into <code>.env.web</code> shows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">PORT=3000</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">PUMA_WORKERS=1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIN_THREADS=4</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MAX_THREADS=16</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">SECRET_KEY_BASE=&lt;Rails secret key&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">AWS_REGION=us-west-2</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain"># ...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the <code>env_file</code> is powerful in that it allows us to swap out environment configurations when you deploy and run your containers. Perhaps your container needs separate configurations on dev than when on CI, or when deployed to staging or on production.</p>

<h2>Creating containers and booting them up.</h2>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to assemble the container. From within the Rails app, run:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose build
</code></pre>

<p>This downloads and builds the containers that your web app and your db will live in, linking them up. You will need to re-run the <code>docker-compose build</code> command every time you change the <code>Dockerfile</code> or <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<h2>Running your app in containers</h2>

<p>You can bring up your Rails server and associated containers by running:</p>

<pre><code>$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>

<p>This is a combination of build, link, and start-services command for
each container. You should see output that indicates that both our <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> containers, as configured in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, are booting up.</p>

<h2>Development workflow</h2>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to discover that developing with Docker added very little overhead to the development process. In fact, most commands that you would run for Rails simply needed to be prepended with a <code>docker-compose run web</code>.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>When you want to run:           </th>
<th> With Docker Compose, you would run:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>bundle install</code>                </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web bundle install</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rails s</code>                       </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web rails s</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb</code>    </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create</code> </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test web rake db:create</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>tail -f log/development.log</code>   </td>
<td> <code>docker-compose run web tail -f log/development.log</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h2>Protips</h2>

<p>Here are some nice development tricks I found useful when working with Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a <code>dockerhost</code> entry to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so you can visit <code>dockerhost</code> from your browser.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>boot2docker ip
</span><span class='line'>192.168.59.104
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  Then add the IP to your <code>/etc/hosts</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>192.168.59.104  dockerhost
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  Now you can pull up your app from <code>dockerhost:3000</code>:</p>

<p>  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/5eqNJqN.png" alt="Screenshot of your URL bar" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Debugging containers with <code>docker exec</code></p>

<p>Sometimes you need to get inside a container to see what&rsquo;s <em>really</em> happening. Perhaps you need to test whether a port is truly open, or verify that a process is truly running. This can be accomplished by grabbing the container ID with a <code>docker ps</code>, then passing that ID into the <code>docker exec</code> command:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker ps
</span><span class='line'>CONTAINER ID        IMAGE

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose run web env
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">AWS_SECRET_KEY</span><span class="o">=</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/root
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>Running an interactive debugger (like <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">pry</a>) in your Docker container</p>

<p>It takes a little extra work to get Docker to allow interactive terminal debugging with tools like <code>byebug</code> or <code>pry</code>. Should you desire to start your web server with debugging capabilities, you will need to use the <code>--service-ports</code> flag with the <code>run</code> command.</p></li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>docker-compose run --service-ports web
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>  This works due to two internal implementations of <code>docker-compose run</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>docker-compose run</code> creates a TTY session for your app to connect to, allowing interactive debugging. The default <code>docker-compose up</code> command does not create a TTY session.</li>
<li><p>The <code>run</code> command does not map ports to the Docker host by default. The <code>--service-ports</code> directive maps the container&rsquo;s ports to the host&rsquo;s ports, allowing you to visit the container from your web browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>slim</code> images when possible on production</p></li>
</ul>


<p>  Oftentimes, your base image will come supplied with a <code>-slim</code> variant on Docker Hub. This usually means that the image maintainer has supplied a trimmed-down version of the container for you to use with source code and build-time files stripped and removed. You can oftentimes shave a couple hundred megabytes off your resulting image &mdash; we did when we switched our <code>ruby</code> image from <code>2.2.1</code> to <code>2.2.1-slim</code>. This results in faster deployment times due to less network I/O from the registry to the deployment target.</p>

<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Remember that your app runs in containers &ndash; so every time you do a <code>docker-compose run</code>, remember that Compose is spinning up entirely new containers for your code <strong>but only if the containers are not up already, in which case they are linked to that (running) container</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ve spun up multiple instances of your app without thinking about it &ndash; for example, you may have a <code>web</code> and <code>db</code> container already up from a <code>docker-compose up</code> command, and then in a separate terminal window you run a <code>docker-compose run web rails c</code>. That spins up <em>another</em> <code>web</code> container to execute the command, but then links that container with the pre-launched <code>db</code> container.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a small but noticeable performance penalty running through both the VirtualBox VM and docker. I&rsquo;ve generally noticed waiting a few extra seconds when starting a Rails environment. My overall experience has been that the penalty has not been large enough to be painful.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Out of <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/storybook">Storybook</a>, a side project I&rsquo;ve been doing for a friend, I had the opportunity to model the problem domain as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). It goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>A set of students are assigned a book a week. Write plan generator to create a set of student-book assignments for that week, given the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>All students must receive a book.</li>
<li>Each book may only be assigned to one student at a time.</li>
<li>A student may not be assigned a book s/he has received before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being that this was a Rails app, I put <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/storybook">Amb</a>, a Ruby-based CSP solver, to use. Amb is derived off <a href="">Jim Weirich&rsquo;s original source code</a>, implementing a simple backtracking algorithm. (More <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?amb">interesting reading on the original idea</a> behind the <code>amb</code> operator, proposed in a <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/basis1.pdf">paper</a> by LISP founder John McCarthy in 1963.)</p>

<p>Not having written any CSP logic since my university days, I tried to come up with a naive solution. It goes something like this:</p>

<p>Well this would work for 2 students and 2 bags, 3 and 3, 4 and 4, but would blow up and overflow the stack when we got to 5 students and 5 bags. Why? I was forcing Ruby to generate the full solution space before starting the CSP search problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">student_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:s1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:s2</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">bag_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:b1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:b2</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># Modeled as: the complete solution space of assignments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">spaces</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">student_ids</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">product</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bag_ids</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; [[:s1, :b1], [:s1, :b2], [:s2, :b1], [:s2, :b2]]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then I was taking that cross product and brute-force generating all possible permutations internal to that:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">spaces</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">permutation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">student_ids</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_a</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; [[[:s1, :b1], [:s1, :b2]], [[:s1, :b1], [:s2, :b1]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s1, :b1], [:s2, :b2]], [[:s1, :b2], [:s1, :b1]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s1, :b2], [:s2, :b1]], [[:s1, :b2], [:s2, :b2]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s2, :b1], [:s1, :b1]], [[:s2, :b1], [:s1, :b2]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s2, :b1], [:s2, :b2]], [[:s2, :b2], [:s1, :b1]],</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">#     [[:s2, :b2], [:s1, :b2]], [[:s2, :b2], [:s2, :b1]]]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The most obvious thing that stood out to me like a sore thumb was how I wasn&rsquo;t simply trusting the constraint-based nature of the problem and expressing the problem in terms of the constraints, instead of attempting to imperatively generate the solution. Usage of <code>Enumerable#permutation</code> resulted in an <em>O(n!)</em> algorithm, which is unacceptable. Back to the drawing board:</p>

<p>Note the main difference here is how I&rsquo;ve re-tooled the solver to assign variables one at a time (in L5) and check constraints after each assignment. This simplifies the domain of the problem as a graph search and helps us more easily reason about this program.</p>

<h3>Further explorations</h3>

<p>Follow my <a href="https://www.github.com/andrewhao/csp-solvers/">csp-solvers</a> project, where I attempt to rewrite this in Prolog and Clojure in an attempt to see how language affects how we reason about problems like these. It&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>
