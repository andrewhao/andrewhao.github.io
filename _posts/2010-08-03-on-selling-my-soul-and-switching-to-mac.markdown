A month ago I bought an '07 MacBook on Craigslist. No, it's not one of those sexy aluminum hot rods, but it sure is pretty.

I was full of mixed emotions. I had finally joined the Tribe! I had sold my soul. I can now develop iPhone apps! I am property of SJ. Yes, I had interned at Apple in the summer of '08, but I haven't really paid much attention to OS X until I've owned one of these suckers for myself.

It's not easy making the switch. Here are some of my gripes with OSX and some stopgap replacements I've found:



	
  * No keyboard shortcut to maximize windows. (Solved with [RightZoom](http://www.blazingtools.com/downloads.html#RightZoom))

	
  * MacPorts really sucks (that is, having to compile everything from source is really slow). (Still outstanding)

	
  * Switching windows between spaces is really clunky. (Sorta solved with [Hyperspaces](http://thecocoabots.com/hyperspaces/))

	
  * No keyboard shortcut to "move active window to space". (Still outstanding)

	
  * No way to force windows to a grid. (Solved with [Divvy](http://www.mizage.com/divvy/))

	
  * No right Ctrl key makes things really painful in Emacs. (Remapped right "Enter" with [DoubleCommand](http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/))

	
  * Aero Snap is cool. (Check out [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/))

	
  * The MacBook keyboard keys feel cheap compared to a Thinkpad. (Still outstanding)

	
  * Really annoyed with Command-Tab switching. I just want to switch to a different window! (Still outstanding).

	
  * Expose feels limited compared to Compiz' Scale plugin. Cannot Expose all windows in all spaces. (Still outstanding)

	
  * Closing window doesn't kill the process. I suspect this is just a design philosophy I have to deal with. (Still outstanding)

	
  * Not sure why, but my wrists generally tend to hurt more after using the MB rather than my work Thinkpad.


Okay, I'm not going to do all complaining. Some things I really enjoy:

	
  * Drag-and-drop installation is totally elegant.

	
  * Time Machine just works, and the zoomable interface is totally slick.

	
  * Helvetica Neue, I love you.

	
  * Something about the font rendering is just amazing.

	
  * I get to look cool (and slightly cliche...) at coffee shops

	
  * Desktop graphics & animations render smoothly with CoreAnimation. This stuff just looks slick.


I guess it's not as bad as I've made it out to be. Well here I am. Swore I'd never do it, but you got me with all that shiny, Mr. Jobs. You got me.
