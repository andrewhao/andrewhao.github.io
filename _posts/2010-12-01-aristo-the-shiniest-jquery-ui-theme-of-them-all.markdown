Let's face it: [jQuery UI skins](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/) suck. They're flat, they're boring, they don't pop.

Enter [Aristo](http://taitems.tumblr.com/post/482577430/introducing-aristo-a-jquery-ui-theme), a jQuery UI port of the [Cappuccino Javascript framework](http://cappuccino.org/) theme.

Much better. Clone the [repo from GitHub](https://github.com/taitems/Aristo-jQuery-UI-Theme) here, or check out a [demo](http://www.warfuric.com/taitems/demo.html).
