[![UN Declaration of Human Rights (Visualization)](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5548186559_70e047238c.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewhao/5548186559/)

This design was created from a Processing sketch that breaks up the preamble to the [UN Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml) and connects adjacent words together with lines. More frequent word associations can be noted by darker, thicker lines.

The source code (albeit messy) can be found at [www.github.com/andrewhao/freedom-sunday](http://www.github.com/andrewhao/freedom-sunday). I'm running the sketch in full Java mode, so be sure to compile with your Java IDE of choice (rather than the Processing IDE).

Inspiration taken from the designs of Harry Kao ([http://www.hairycow.name](http://www.hairycow.name)) and Jer Thorp ([http://blog.blprnt.com](http://blog.blprnt.com)).

My fellow interns and I are headed off to Cebu for 10 days to observe organizations involved in anti-trafficking efforts. More info: [interns.regenerationweb.com](http://interns.regenerationweb.com)
