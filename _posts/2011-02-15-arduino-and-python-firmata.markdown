I just spent five hours trying to figure out why Â none of the [Firmata libraries for Python](http://arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Python) were working over my serial connection. I was wondering why the previous program remained on the board and none of the signals sent were hot.

Hint: you need to load Firmata first onto the board before it can understand the protocol. Oh. Duh.

Only "OldStandardFirmata" (Firmata 2.0) seems to work with my version of [python-firmata](https://github.com/lupeke/python-firmata). The newer Firmata PDEs can talk Firmata 2.1 and 2.2, but I'm too tired to figure them out.
