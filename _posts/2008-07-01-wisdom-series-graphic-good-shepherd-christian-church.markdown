I was commissioned to create graphics for a sermon series titled "Wisdom" at my home church, [Good Shepherd](http://www.gschristian.org/). Some of the artists and leaders decided to go with a lantern motif. I went ahead and sketched up these graphics in Illustrator, bumbling around a bit with the [gradient mesh tool](http://createsk8.com/2007/illustrator-tutorial-free-glass-symbol-library/) in the process.
