Okay, I confess. I've been daydreaming about winter break:



	
  1. Sleeping in.

	
  2. The laughter of friends.

	
  3. Taking a day trip with a camera to Monterey/Carmel (or anywhere awesome).

	
  4. Working (uninterrupted) on [Wejoinin](http://www.wejoinin.com).

	
  5. Redesigning the [blog](http://blog.g9labs.com)? Updating the [portfolio](http://portfolio.g9labs.com)? (Good Lord, it's about time).

	
  6. Kicking it with Jesus.

	
  7. Working on a few songs, and maybe trying a bit of recording.

	
  8. Reading, reading, reading, then writing, writing, writing.

	
  9. Spending the holidays with family.


And hooray! I'm finally done with interviews. I'll be taking an internship at [Apple](http://www.apple.com) this summer doing software engineering and Web development. I'm real excited about (and very thankful for) the opportunity to hang out with the cool kids.
