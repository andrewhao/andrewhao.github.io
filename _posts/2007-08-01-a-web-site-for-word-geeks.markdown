Have you ever compiled long lists of words you thought were awesome (don't lie, I've met two or three of you)? Do you love words such as "[phthisis](http://wordie.org/words/phthisis)" and "[tantamount](http://wordie.org/words/tantamount)" simply because they 1) sound awesome and 2) look awesome? Do you drool at the possibilities of using them in some obscure poem/technical document/research thesis to the cheers and unadulterated praise and raw jealousy of your peers and professors?

Then [Wordie](http://wordie.org/) is your Web site. Think of it as a social network for word geeks. Awesome.
