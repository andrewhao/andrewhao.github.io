### CascadiaJS: Let's Go Fast! Creating a Culture of Frontend Performance

What do Liberian tailors and Xerox field techs have in common? They co-create learning communities - more famously known as "Communities of Practice" - to spread best practices, share learnings and upskill newcomers.

If you're looking to enact sociotechnical change within your org, this is worth a watch. A talk about culture change, and how it can be driven from the bottom-up from the practitioners themselves.

### React Summit 2021: Platform-powered: Building a Frontend Platform that Scales

I shared how Lyft was upgrading its frontend platform stack to Next.js - and gave insights on how tooling was the secret lever to move all 100+ services to the next generation stack. A talk relevant to any company looking to spin up platform teams and looking for high-leverage places to build products.

### ProductWorld 2020: We are All Product Owners

A talk about how the engineers on my team, with the departure of our then-product manager, developed the mindset of product owners with an empowered model of discovering, planning and executing impactful projects.

I turned this into a tweet and a series of blog articles ([Part 1]({% post_url 2020-05-11-product-owner-engineering-teams-part-1 %}), [Part 2]({% post_url 2020-06-23-product-owner-engineering-teams-part-2-the-idea-backlog %}), [Part 3]({% post_url 2020-08-17-product-owner-engineering-teams-part-3-project-drivers %}) and [Part 4]({% post_url 2020-08-17-product-owner-engineering-teams-part-4-the-four-hats %})). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for coming out to hear us speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEVWEEK2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DEVWEEK2020</a>! To summarize: we run a self-organizing product-owner eng team at Lyft. How do we do that? We train all engineers to take on product ownership by wearing a &quot;Product Hat&quot; ðŸŽ© on the team. <a href="https://t.co/wwc0TVxGjr">pic.twitter.com/wwc0TVxGjr</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Hao (@andrewhao) <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewhao/status/1228823278233382912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### PyGotham 2019: Can Neural Networks Make Me a Better Parent?

A talk about my Deep Learning Baby Monitor project, which I used to prove some greater insights into the need to incorporate human feedback loops into our ML pipelines. I wrote about this project in [several]({% post_url 2018-03-21-tensorflow-for-tears-part-1 %}) [other]({% post_url 2018-08-27-tensorflow-for-tears-part-2 %}) [posts]({% post_url 2019-10-06-what-training-an-audio-recognition-cnn-taught-me-about-parenting-and-about-humane-ml %}) on this [blog]({% post_url 2019-12-07-on-using-personas-in-user-centered-ml-model-development %}) and on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/integrating-personas-in-user-centered-ml-model-development-afb593741c49).

### Elixir Mix 053 - "Building beautiful systems with Phoenix Contexts and DDD with Andrew Hao"

I appeared on the Elixir Mix podcast with hosts Mark Ericksen and Josh Adams to discuss Domain-Driven Design and how it can be used with Phoenix contexts. We even go into an exercise I love called Context Mapping. [Listen to the episode on Elixir Mix](https://elixirmix.com/53) or on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/emx-053-building-beautiful-systems-phoenix-contexts/id1379029137?i=1000439929527).

### Namegames - Solving the Hardest Problem in Computer Science

A deep dive into the linguistic origins of naming with a detour into semiotics and communication theory. If you get through this, you'll be better able to understand why Domain-Driven Design leans so hard into the linguistic connotations of systems.
