### PyGotham 2019: Can Neural Networks Make Me a Better Parent?

A talk about my Deep Learning Baby Monitor project, which I used to prove some greater insights into the need to incorporate human feedback loops into our ML pipelines. I wrote about this project in [several]({% post_url 2018-03-21-tensorflow-for-tears-part-1 %}) [other]({% post_url 2018-08-27-tensorflow-for-tears-part-2 %}) [posts]({% post_url 2019-10-06-what-training-an-audio-recognition-cnn-taught-me-about-parenting-and-about-humane-ml %}) on this [blog]({% post_url 2019-12-07-on-using-personas-in-user-centered-ml-model-development %}).

### Namegames - Solving the Hardest Problem in Computer Science

A deep dive into the linguistic origins of naming with a detour into semiotics and communication theory. If you get through this, you'll be better able to understand why Domain-Driven Design leans so hard into the linguistic connotations of systems.
