I'm Andrew, nice to meet you. I'm currently a Staff Engineer at Lyft, overseeing Lyft's organic acquisition strategy for our riders and drivers. I write often about how we try to [build product-owner mindsets]({% post_url 2020-05-11-product-owner-engineering-teams-part-1 %}) on the team by empowering engineers to act as product owners.

Prior to that, I was a Principal Engineer at [Carbon Five](https://www.carbonfive.com/), where I helped build some great products for clients like Stitch Fix, TaskRabbit, Guild Education, and more. I really loved my time with the great people here, and I reflected on my time here in my article, ["Consider Consulting"]({% post_url 2022-03-07-consider-consulting %}).

At [Blurb](https://www.blurb.com), I was a tech lead that transitioned into engineering management. I learned a lot from that experience, which I [write about often]({% post_url 2019-03-11-mistakes-of-a-first-time-manager %}) and from that experience I apply as much to my current role. I'm a firm believer of the [Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/), so don't be surprised if you see me back in management one of these days.

I [talk](/talks) a lot about Domain-Driven Design, and I've spoken at several Ruby and Elixir conferences on the topic. I also love XP (the process) and pair programming (the practice), both of which I sadly find too rare in the industry these days. I've dabbled a bit in [machine learning]({% post_url 2018-03-21-tensorflow-for-tears-part-1 %}) in my free time and a bit at work.

I also [contribute articles for LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/community/andrew-hao), where you can read some of my writing.

You can find me tweeting (rarely) on Twitter at [@andrewhao](https://www.twitter.com/andrewhao), or more professionally at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhao/). All my talks are listed on my [Talks](/talks) page.
