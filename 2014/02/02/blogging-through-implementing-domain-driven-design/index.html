			<p>In recent conversations with coworkers, the topic of Domain-Driven Design has
arisen on more than a few occasions in design and architecture meetings.
&ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo; a coworker asked, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d help us a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten my hands on a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing Domain-Driven Design</a>
by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/">Vaughn Vernon</a>, which is a more pragmatic
approach to DDD than the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y">Domain-Driven Design</a> book by Eric Evans.</p>

<p>My desire is to share my outlines of the book chapter-by-chapter,
hopefully once a week.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Getting Started with DDD</h2>

<h3>Can I DDD?</h3>

<ul>
<li>DDD helps us design software models where &ldquo;our design is exactly how
the software works&rdquo; (1).</li>
<li>DDD isn&rsquo;t a technology, it&rsquo;s a set of principles that involve
discussion, listening, and business value so you can <em>centralize
knowledge</em>.</li>
<li>The main principle here is that we must &ldquo;understand the business in
which our software works&rdquo; (3). This means we learn from domain experts
in our field.</li>
<li>What is a domain model? an object model where objects have
data/persistence concerns with an accurate business meaning.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why You Should Do DDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Domain experts and devs on same playing field, cooperation required as
one team. (Agile teams, anyone?)</li>
<li>The business can learn more about itself through the questions asked
about itself.</li>
<li>Knowledge is centralized.</li>
<li>Zero translations between domain experts and software devs and
software.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The design is the code, and code is the design.&rdquo; (7)</li>
<li>It is not without up-front cost</li>
</ul>


<h4>The problem</h4>

<ul>
<li>The schism between business domain experts and software developers
puts your project (and your business) at a risk.</li>
<li>The more time passes, the greater the divide grows.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Solution</h4>

<ul>
<li>DDD brings domain experts and software developers together to develop
software that reflects the business domain mental model.</li>
<li>Oftentimes this requires that they jointly develop a &ldquo;Ubiquitous
Language&rdquo; &ndash; a shared vocabulary and set of concepts that are jointly
spoken by everybody.</li>
<li>DDD produces software that is better designed &amp; architected &ndash;> better testable &ndash;>
clearer code.</li>
<li>Take heed: DDD should only be used to simplify your domain. If the net
cost of implementing DDD is only going to add complexity, then you
should stay away.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Domain model health</h4>

<ul>
<li>As time passes, our domain models can become
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">anemic</a>,
and lose their expressive capabilities and clean boundaries. This can
lead to spaghetti code and a violation of object responsibilities.</li>
<li>Why do anemic domain models hurt us? They claim to be well-formed
models but they hide a badly designed system that is still unfocused
in what it does. (Andrew: I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Service objects that
claim to be services but really are long scripts to get things done.
There might be a cost of designing the Service interface, but inside
things are just as messy as before we got there.)</li>
<li>Seems like Vernon is blaming the influence of IDEs for Visual Basic as
they influenced Java libraries &mdash; too many explicit getters and
setters.</li>
<li>Vernon throws up some code samples comparing two different code
samples &mdash; one with an anemic model that looks like a long string of
commands and another with descriptive method names. He makes the case
that simply reading the code is documentation of the domain itself.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How to do DDD</h4>

<ul>
<li>Have a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"><em>Ubiquitous Language</em></a>
where the team of domain experts share the language together, from
domain experts to programmers.</li>
<li><p>Steps to coming up with a language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Draw out the domain and label it.</li>
<li>Make a glossary of terms and definitions.</li>
<li>Have the team review the language document.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Note that a Ubiquitous Language is specific to the context it is
implemented in. In other words, there is one Ubiquitous Language per
Bounded Context.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Business value of DDD</h3>

<ol>
<li>The organization gains a useful model of its domain</li>
<li>The precise definition of the business is developed</li>
<li>Domain experts contribute to software design.</li>
<li>A better user experience is gained.</li>
<li>Clean boundaries for models keep them pure.</li>
<li>Enterprise architecture is better designed.</li>
<li>Continuous modeling is used &mdash; the working software we produce is the
model we worked so hard to create.</li>
<li>New tools and patterns are used.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
<li>The time and effort required to think about the busines domain,
research concepts, and converse with domain experts.</li>
<li>It may be hard to get a domain expert involved due to their
availability.</li>
<li>There is a lot of thought required to clarify pure models and do
domain modeling.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Tactical modeling</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Core Domain</em> is the part of your application that has key and
important business value &mdash; and may require high thought and attention
to design.</li>
<li>Sometimes DDD may not be the right fit for you &mdash; if you have a lot of
experienced developers who are very comfortable with domain modeling,
you may be better off trusting their opinion.</li>
</ul>


<h4>DDD is not heavy.</h4>

<ul>
<li>It fits into any Agile or XP framework. It leans into TDD, eg: you use
TDD to develop a new domain model that describes how it interacts with
other existing models. You go through the red-green-refactor cycle.</li>
<li>DDD promotes lightweight development. As domain experts read the code, they
are able to provide in-flight feedback to the development of the
system.</li>
</ul>
