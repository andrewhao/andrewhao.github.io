    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been hitting a lot of “Maximum file limit exceeded” dialogs after a long day at work – at any point in time I’ve got a kajillion Chrome tabs open, five or six Rails envs running (for dev and test) + Guard/Spork actively watching tests, and Sublime with another kajillion tabs open.</p>

<p>Turns out that OSX limits the number of open file descriptors per process to 256. Time to bump up the limit:</p>

<p>First, check out your current file limit:</p>

<p><code>$ launchctl limit</code></p>

<pre><code>    cpu         unlimited      unlimited      
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited      
    data        unlimited      unlimited      
    stack       8388608        67104768       
    core        0              unlimited      
    rss         unlimited      unlimited      
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited      
    maxproc     709            1064           
    maxfiles    256            unlimited
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, let’s crank ‘er up. First let’s create <code>/etc/launchctl.conf</code></p>

<p><code>$ sudo touch /etc/launchctl.conf</code></p>

<p>And let’s open it with your editor of choice. Add the following line to the new file:</p>

<p><code>limit maxfiles 16384 32768</code></p>

<p>Restart your computer. Boom. Easy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month ago I bought an ‘07 MacBook on Craigslist. No, it’s not one of those sexy aluminum hot rods, but it sure is pretty.</p>

<p>I was full of mixed emotions. I had finally joined the Tribe! I had sold my soul. I can now develop iPhone apps! I am property of SJ. Yes, I had interned at Apple in the summer of ‘08, but I haven’t really paid much attention to OS X until I’ve owned one of these suckers for myself.</p>

<p>It’s not easy making the switch. Here are some of my gripes with OSX and some stopgap replacements I’ve found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No keyboard shortcut to maximize windows. (Solved with <a href="http://www.blazingtools.com/downloads.html#RightZoom">RightZoom</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MacPorts really sucks (that is, having to compile everything from source is really slow). (Still outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switching windows between spaces is really clunky. (Sorta solved with <a href="http://thecocoabots.com/hyperspaces/">Hyperspaces</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No keyboard shortcut to “move active window to space”. (Still outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No way to force windows to a grid. (Solved with <a href="http://www.mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No right Ctrl key makes things really painful in Emacs. (Remapped right “Enter” with <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aero Snap is cool. (Check out <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/">Cinch</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The MacBook keyboard keys feel cheap compared to a Thinkpad. (Still outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really annoyed with Command-Tab switching. I just want to switch to a different window! (Still outstanding).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expose feels limited compared to Compiz’ Scale plugin. Cannot Expose all windows in all spaces. (Still outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Closing window doesn’t kill the process. I suspect this is just a design philosophy I have to deal with. (Still outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not sure why, but my wrists generally tend to hurt more after using the MB rather than my work Thinkpad.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, I’m not going to do all complaining. Some things I really enjoy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Drag-and-drop installation is totally elegant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time Machine just works, and the zoomable interface is totally slick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helvetica Neue, I love you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something about the font rendering is just amazing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I get to look cool (and slightly cliche…) at coffee shops</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Desktop graphics &amp; animations render smoothly with CoreAnimation. This stuff just looks slick.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I guess it’s not as bad as I’ve made it out to be. Well here I am. Swore I’d never do it, but you got me with all that shiny, Mr. Jobs. You got me.</p>
