    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an ultra runner, I am really into the mountains. As a software engineer, I’m really into data. So naturally, I’m interested in the intersection of both.</p>

<p>I’ve particularly been interested in how systems like <a href="http://www.strava.com">Strava</a> work, especially when they quantify what is known as a “Suffer Score”, a single number denoting the amount of training stress (a.k.a. suffering) you put yourself through in a workout.</p>

<p>How does a track workout compare to a long day on the trails? Which is tougher: a 5m tempo road run in and around my neighborhood, or a tough 2m climb into a local regional park?</p>

<h2 id="data-in">Data in…</h2>

<p>I first attacked the problem of getting data off of my phone. I record my GPX tracks in <a href="http://runmeter.com/">Runmeter</a>, a fantastic iPhone application with all sorts of metrics and data export capabilities. What I wanted was a seamless way to get the data off my phone without fuss after a hard workout.</p>

<p>The application has a nifty feature in which it can automatically send an email to an email address after a workout is completed.</p>

<p>I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/velocitas">email ingester, Velocitas</a>, with the help of <a href="http://cloudmailin.com/">Cloudmailin</a>, which fires off a POST request to the Node application. Velocitas does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>curl</code>s and downloads the GPX link embedded in the email.</li>
  <li>Saves the GPX file to a linked Dropbox account.</li>
  <li>Republishes the GPX file to a linked Strava account.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deriving-the-training-stress-score">Deriving the Training Stress Score</h2>

<p>Next up: I wanted to do a quick and dirty implementation of the (run-based) Training Stress Score. <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/stressfactor">Stressfactor</a>, a Ruby gem, is what came out of it.</p>

<p>It implements the rTSS as detailed in <a href="http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/running-training-stress-score-rtss-explained">this article</a>.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>(duration_seconds * normalized_graded_pace * intensity_factor) /
<span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span>(functional_threshold_pace * <span style="color:#00D">3600</span>) * <span style="color:#00D">100</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Stressfactor is a higher-order tookit for deriving meaning from GPX tracks, so it, at the moment, attempts to calculate the stress score and grade adjusted pace.</p>

<p>The data still needs validation, so I’m eager to run it on my data set of GPX tracks from the past years.</p>

<h2 id="generating-reports">Generating reports</h2>

<p>I’m working on this part right now – I need to nicely display a report from my workout history in Dropbox and display per-GPX. I’ve started the project – <a href="https://github.com/andrewhao/stressreport">Stressreport</a>.</p>

<h2 id="some-things-ive-learned-and-am-learning">Some things I’ve learned and am learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The human body is complex, and cannot be <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Modeling_Human_Performance">easily modeled</a> without sufficient data. That said, what I’m doing now may be sufficient for basic training data.</li>
  <li>The nature of parsing and generating higher-order stats from raw data may lend itself well to experimentation with functional languages. I’m interested in trying to reimplement Stressfactor in Scala, or a functional equivalent.</li>
  <li>Deploying all my apps on Heroku’s free tier may actually be an interesting start to building a microservice architecture – with the space limitations on Heroku, I’m forced to build new features on new services. Call it cheapskate architecture.</li>
</ul>
