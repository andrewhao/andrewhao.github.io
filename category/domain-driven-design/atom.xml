    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Chapter 2: Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts</h2>

<p>A <em>Domain</em> is what a business does and the surrounding context of how it does business. It is important to model out its supported <em>Subdomains</em> &mdash; that is, the smaller components of the business that collaborate in real, day-to-day operations of the business. The book describes these as <em>Core Domains</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, a <em>Bounded Context</em> is the physical manifestation of the solution space as software &mdash; models living in a real application. Its key feature in the context of DDD is as a linguistic barrier between different domains.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, each <em>Subdomain</em> maps directly to one <em>Bounded Context</em>. In the real world, this is less common since we tend to build things into monolithic systems. Still &mdash; many monolithic applications have several components that could in themselves be bounded contexts.</p>

<h6>Side note: In Rails, one could think of Engines as a <em>Bounded Context</em>. But that might be a blog post for another time.</h6>

<p>It is important to get these ideas and concepts down correctly because we need correct modeling of our systems to determine what they do.</p>

<h3>Bounded Contexts and terms</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not usually realistic to get the entire organization agreeing on a universal linguistic definition for every term. Instead, DDD assumes that different terms have different meanings in different contexts.</p>

<p>The author then dives into the an example of a book, where a <em>book</em> means several different things to different people in different contexts. A book is touched upon by authors, graphic designers, editors, marketing folks. In each of these contexts, the features of a book mean different things at different times. It is impossible to develop an all-knowing Book model without disagreement between stakeholders. DDD, instead, acknowledges these differences and allows stakeholders to use linguistic terms from within their unique Bounded Contexts.</p>

<p>Bounded Contexts may include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object models</li>
<li>A database schema / persistence layer</li>
<li>A SOAP or REST API</li>
<li>A user interface</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bounded context antipatterns</h3>

<p>You may be tempted to divide up a bounded context by architectural concerns, or because you want to assign smaller tasks to developers (resource allocation). Beware that this kind of work tends to fragment the language.</p>

<p>DDD operates on <em>linquistic drivers</em>. The unity, cohesion and domain-adherence of the bounded context should be the first priority in the design.</p>

<p>Assigning two teams to the same bounded context results in fragmentation of the bounded context.</p>

<p>Ideally: we strive to assign one team to work on one Bounded Context with one Ubiquitous Language at a time.</p>

<h6>In Rails, what are the bounded contexts? It could be the top-level Rails application, or an engine, or a gem, that define the context boundaries._</h6>

<h3>A story&hellip;</h3>

<p>The chapter then goes on to describe their fictional team designing through three iterations off their DDD strategy:</p>

<p>A system in which all domains live within the same bounded context. They see the folly of this and refactor with some tactical patterns, like creating services.</p>

<p>This is, however, missing the point. They realized they needed to listen to business and their domain experts to find out exactly where the right places were to segregate the contexts. The team discovers that the business has a desire to go in a new direction which allows them to segregate the domain in such a way that would enable future directions for the business.</p>

<h6>How often are we as developers in conversation with our product owners and asking where the business <em>wants</em> to go in the future?</h6>

<p>Conversations with the business reveal an intention to develop an add-on product to the core product. This implies the development of two subdomains. However, further investigation reveals that the shared overlap of certain domain models (like users, roles, and access management) cannot simply be identically shared between two systems, since their <em>linguistic meanings</em> in the two systems differ slightly. Instead, the developers use the linguistic problem to develop a third bounded context.</p>

<p>The developers separate their app into three bounded contexts built as three software systems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent conversations with coworkers, the topic of Domain-Driven Design has
arisen on more than a few occasions in design and architecture meetings.
&ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo; a coworker asked, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d help us a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten my hands on a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing Domain-Driven Design</a>
by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/">Vaughn Vernon</a>, which is a more pragmatic
approach to DDD than the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y">Domain-Driven Design</a> book by Eric Evans.</p>

<p>My desire is to share my outlines of the book chapter-by-chapter,
hopefully once a week.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Getting Started with DDD</h2>

<h3>Can I DDD?</h3>

<ul>
<li>DDD helps us design software models where &ldquo;our design is exactly how
the software works&rdquo; (1).</li>
<li>DDD isn&rsquo;t a technology, it&rsquo;s a set of principles that involve
discussion, listening, and business value so you can <em>centralize
knowledge</em>.</li>
<li>The main principle here is that we must &ldquo;understand the business in
which our software works&rdquo; (3). This means we learn from domain experts
in our field.</li>
<li>What is a domain model? an object model where objects have
data/persistence concerns with an accurate business meaning.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why You Should Do DDD</h3>

<ul>
<li>Domain experts and devs on same playing field, cooperation required as
one team. (Agile teams, anyone?)</li>
<li>The business can learn more about itself through the questions asked
about itself.</li>
<li>Knowledge is centralized.</li>
<li>Zero translations between domain experts and software devs and
software.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The design is the code, and code is the design.&rdquo; (7)</li>
<li>It is not without up-front cost</li>
</ul>


<h4>The problem</h4>

<ul>
<li>The schism between business domain experts and software developers
puts your project (and your business) at a risk.</li>
<li>The more time passes, the greater the divide grows.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Solution</h4>

<ul>
<li>DDD brings domain experts and software developers together to develop
software that reflects the business domain mental model.</li>
<li>Oftentimes this requires that they jointly develop a &ldquo;Ubiquitous
Language&rdquo; &ndash; a shared vocabulary and set of concepts that are jointly
spoken by everybody.</li>
<li>DDD produces software that is better designed &amp; architected &ndash;> better testable &ndash;>
clearer code.</li>
<li>Take heed: DDD should only be used to simplify your domain. If the net
cost of implementing DDD is only going to add complexity, then you
should stay away.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Domain model health</h4>

<ul>
<li>As time passes, our domain models can become
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">anemic</a>,
and lose their expressive capabilities and clean boundaries. This can
lead to spaghetti code and a violation of object responsibilities.</li>
<li>Why do anemic domain models hurt us? They claim to be well-formed
models but they hide a badly designed system that is still unfocused
in what it does. (Andrew: I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Service objects that
claim to be services but really are long scripts to get things done.
There might be a cost of designing the Service interface, but inside
things are just as messy as before we got there.)</li>
<li>Seems like Vernon is blaming the influence of IDEs for Visual Basic as
they influenced Java libraries &mdash; too many explicit getters and
setters.</li>
<li>Vernon throws up some code samples comparing two different code
samples &mdash; one with an anemic model that looks like a long string of
commands and another with descriptive method names. He makes the case
that simply reading the code is documentation of the domain itself.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How to do DDD</h4>

<ul>
<li>Have a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"><em>Ubiquitous Language</em></a>
where the team of domain experts share the language together, from
domain experts to programmers.</li>
<li><p>Steps to coming up with a language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Draw out the domain and label it.</li>
<li>Make a glossary of terms and definitions.</li>
<li>Have the team review the language document.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Note that a Ubiquitous Language is specific to the context it is
implemented in. In other words, there is one Ubiquitous Language per
Bounded Context.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Business value of DDD</h3>

<ol>
<li>The organization gains a useful model of its domain</li>
<li>The precise definition of the business is developed</li>
<li>Domain experts contribute to software design.</li>
<li>A better user experience is gained.</li>
<li>Clean boundaries for models keep them pure.</li>
<li>Enterprise architecture is better designed.</li>
<li>Continuous modeling is used &mdash; the working software we produce is the
model we worked so hard to create.</li>
<li>New tools and patterns are used.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
<li>The time and effort required to think about the busines domain,
research concepts, and converse with domain experts.</li>
<li>It may be hard to get a domain expert involved due to their
availability.</li>
<li>There is a lot of thought required to clarify pure models and do
domain modeling.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Tactical modeling</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <em>Core Domain</em> is the part of your application that has key and
important business value &mdash; and may require high thought and attention
to design.</li>
<li>Sometimes DDD may not be the right fit for you &mdash; if you have a lot of
experienced developers who are very comfortable with domain modeling,
you may be better off trusting their opinion.</li>
</ul>


<h4>DDD is not heavy.</h4>

<ul>
<li>It fits into any Agile or XP framework. It leans into TDD, eg: you use
TDD to develop a new domain model that describes how it interacts with
other existing models. You go through the red-green-refactor cycle.</li>
<li>DDD promotes lightweight development. As domain experts read the code, they
are able to provide in-flight feedback to the development of the
system.</li>
</ul>
